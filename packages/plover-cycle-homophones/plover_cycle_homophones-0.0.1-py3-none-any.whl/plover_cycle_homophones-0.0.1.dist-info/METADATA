# Plover Cycle through homophones 

Companion plugin for BépoSténo - includes the following macros:
- split_previous
  split the last word's two last syllables. This is in case plover reads the last two strokes as a single word (eg "A-LAn" turning into "allant" when you want "a lent")
- space_or_split
  insert a space or split the last word's two last syllables.
- find_homophone
  cycles through homophones from the dictionnary
