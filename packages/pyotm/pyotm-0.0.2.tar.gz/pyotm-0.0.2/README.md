OTM is a platform for simulating vehicular traffic scenarios. It offers multiple models that can be arbitrarily combined in a single simulation. You can use one of the native OTM models (CTM, 2Q, Newell), or you can create a plugin for your own model. You can similarly implement new controllers as plugins.
