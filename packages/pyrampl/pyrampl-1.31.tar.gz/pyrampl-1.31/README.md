# PyRamPL

* **PyRamPl** is a simple Python package for simulating
  Random Access Memory Machine programs within the context of an introductory course on computational models.
* It is a lightweight package especially designed for
  small RAM programs, such as those that are presented
  in introductory academic courses on the theory of computation.
* It can be a useful companion for theoretical courses on
  computation models and languages who wish also to engage
  the students with some programming experience and skills.
  * It was designed to be used in such a course by the author
    (Hebrew book at http://samyzaf.com/afl.pdf).
  * It enables students to easily experiment with RAM programs for their exercises,
    and to test correctness of their solutions.
* It also provide an opportunity for students to get a taste of how programming looks like
  while learning theoretical computation course.
* There are many different definitions of a RAM machine in the literature but from an educational
  perspective most of them are adequate for presenting a computational model resembling a modern computer system
  and its associated assembly programming language.
* WARNING! Our current very early version of **PyRamPl** is not
  making good syntactical checks, so make sure to write your
  programs correctly or else you will not get any meaningful feedback.
