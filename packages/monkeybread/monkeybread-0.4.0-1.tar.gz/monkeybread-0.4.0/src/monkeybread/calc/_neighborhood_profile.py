    """Calculates a neighborhood profile for each cell. The resulting AnnData object will have the
    same index corresponding to rows/cells, but a new index corresponding to columns, one column for

    category.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    groupby
        A categorical column in `obs` to use for neighborhood profile calculations.
    basis
        A key in `adata.obsm` to use for cell coordinates.
    neighborhood_groups
        A list of groups from `adata.obs[groupby]` to include in the resulting `adata.var_names`.
        Will not affect the calculations themselves, only which results are provided.
    subset_groups
        A list of groups in `adata.obs[groupby]` to restrict the resulting AnnData object to. Only
        cells in those groups will be included in the resulting `adata.obs_names`.
    radius
        Radius in coordinate space to include nearby cells for neighborhood profile calculation.
    normalize_counts
        Normalize neighborhood counts to proportions instead of raw counts. Note, if
        `neighborhood_groups` is provided and `normalize_counts = True`, the normalization step will
        be performed before removing groups, so proportions will not sum to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    A new AnnData object where columns now correspond to neighborhood profile proportions. All .obs
    columns will be carried over from the provided AnnData object, and they will share an index.
