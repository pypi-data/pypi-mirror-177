# AzCam

*azcam* is an python package used to control an observation from a scientific imaging camera. It is intended to be used as an interface to multiple non-standard hardware interfaces such as camera controllers, telescopes, instruments, and temperature controllers.

The *azcam* package is currently used for Astronomical Research Cameras, Inc. Gen3, Gen2, and Gen1 CCD controllers, Magellan Guider controllers, STA Archon controllers, and CMOS cameras using ASCOM. Hadrware-specific code is found in azcam *extension* packages. 

See *azcam-tool* for a common extension package which implements a GUI used by many observers.

## Documentation

See https://mplesser.github.io/azcam/

See https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-tool.git for the standard GUI used by most telescope observers.

## Installation

`pip install azcam`

Or download the latest version from from github: https://github.com/mplesser/azcam.git.

You may need to install `python3-tk` on Linux systems [`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`].

## Startup and configuration

An *azcamserver* process is really only useful with a customized configuration script and environment which defines the hardware to be controlled.  Configuration scripts from existing environments may be used as examples. They would be imported into a python or IPython session or uses a startup script such to create a new server or console application.
