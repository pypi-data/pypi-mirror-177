# vtkAddon

## Overview

This module contains general-purpose features that may be integrated into VTK library in the future.

## Contact

Questions regarding this project should be posted on 3D Slicer forum: https://discourse.slicer.org

## History

The original vtkAddon library was created and integrated into Slicer by Andras Lasso (PerkLab, Queen's University)
in March 2015, and maintained by the Slicer community since then.

In July 2015, Bill Lorensen copied the vtkAddon sources into a [dedicated repository][lorensen-vtkAddon] and added
support to build the library as a VTK remote module. Since this new repository duplicated the content already available
in the Slicer source tree, it was not maintained.

Finally, in March 2020, this GitHub project was created by extracting the history from the main Slicer repository
and the project was [integrated][slicer-vtkAddon-pr] into Slicer had a remote project.
