# Config Files

Config files are used to save the current state of the map and all the data downloaded during a session using CoastSeg. The config file is actually composed of two separate files a `.geojson` file and `.json` file. The `.geojson` file contains a geodataframe with crs `espg 4326` that contains all the shorelines, transects,selected ROI, and the bounding box(bbox) that were present on the map when the download button was clicked. The `.json` file contains the settings (eg `preprocess settings`,`postprocess settings`, and `shoreline extraction settings`) and user specified inputs (eg `dates`, `landsat_collection`,`satellite list`) that were used to download the imagery from Google Earth Engine(GEE). Each set of config files is saved in the directory containing the imagery you downloaded. As you can see in the image there are three directories at the top whose names begin with `ID` followed by a number ex `ID0`. These directories are in the same order you clicked the ROIs on the map so `ID0` is the data from the first ROI.

Inside these directories you should see two config files `config_id_<ROI ID>.json` and `config_id_gdf_<ROI ID>.json`. The `<ROI ID>` is the unique identifier of the ROI which can be used to select it by id from the geodataframe in `config_id_gdf_<ROI ID>.json`. You don't need to memorize or do anything with the ROI id.

## Saving Config Files

---

Config files are automatically saved in the `data` directory within each ROI directory when `Download ROIs` is clicked.
Config files can be saved at any time when the `Save Config Files` button. If the ROIs selected on the map have been downloaded before and exist in the `data` directory then the config files will be stored in within each ROI directory. If the ROIs on the map have not been downloaded before then the config files will be saved in the coastseg directory.

#### Steps

1. Click the ROIs on the map you want to save
2. Click the `Save Config Files` button.

## Loading Config Files

---

### Load Config Files For Download ROIs

To load config files for ROIs that have been downloaded before go to the `data` directory within `coastseg` then find the directory of the ROIs you want to upload. Inside that directory, for example the
`ID_3_datetime10-20-22__07_09_07` directory, there should be `geojson` file named `config_gdf_id_3.geojson`. You should notice the `ID_<ROI ID NUMBER>` in the directory name and the geojson file match, in this case this is ROI id 3. Upload the `config_gdf_id_<roi id number>.geojson`.
This will load the ROI in that directory and all the other selected ROIs,shorelines, transects, and the bounding box that were on the map when it was saved.

#### Steps

1. Click `Load Config`
2. Open `data` directory
3. Open ROI directory ex. **ID_3_datetime10-20-22\_\_07_09_07**
4. Select `config_gdf_id_<roi id number>.geojson` ex. **config_gdf_id_3.geojson**

### Load Config Files For ROIs That Have Not Been Downloaded

To load config files for ROIs that have not been downloaded before first click the `Load Config` button, open the coastseg directory and select `config_gdf.geojson`. This will loaded the selected ROIs, shorelines, transects, and bounding box that was saved with the `Save Config Files` button.
NOTE: You will not be able to extract shorelines or compute transects until you download the data for these ROIs.

#### Steps

1. Click `Load Config`
2. Open `coastseg` application directory
3. Select `config_gdf.geojson`
