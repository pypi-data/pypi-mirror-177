class DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator():
    """
    This class wraps an Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse latency-compensated
    vision measurements with differential drive encoder measurements. It will
    correct for noisy vision measurements and encoder drift. It is intended to be
    an easy drop-in for :class:`DifferentialDriveOdometry`. In fact, if you never call
    :meth:`addVisionMeasurement`, and only call :meth:`update`, this will behave exactly the
    same as DifferentialDriveOdometry.

    :meth:`update` should be called every robot loop (if your robot loops are faster or
    slower than the default, then you should change the nominal delta time via
    the constructor).

    :meth:`addVisionMeasurement` can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
    never call it, then this class will behave like regular encoder odometry.

    The state-space system used internally has the following states (x), inputs
    (u), and outputs (y):

    :math:`x = [x, y, \theta, dist_l, dist_r]^T` in the field coordinate
    system containing x position, y position, heading, left encoder distance,
    and right encoder distance.

    :math:`u = [v_l, v_r, d\theta]^T` containing left wheel velocity,
    right wheel velocity, and change in gyro heading.

    NB: Using velocities make things considerably easier, because it means that
    teams don't have to worry about getting an accurate model. Basically, we
    suspect that it's easier for teams to get good encoder data than it is for
    them to perform system identification well enough to get a good model.

    :math:`y = [x, y, \theta]^T` from vision containing x position, y
    position, and heading; or :math:`y = [dist_l, dist_r, \theta]^T`
    containing left encoder position, right encoder position, and gyro heading.

    A Kalman filter combines predictions from a model and measurements to give an
    estimate of the true system state. This is useful because many states cannot
    be measured directly as a result of sensor noise, or because the state is
    "hidden".

    Kalman filters use a K gain matrix to determine whether to trust the model or
    measurements more. Kalman filter theory uses statistics to compute an optimal
    K gain which minimizes the sum of squares error in the state estimate. This K
    gain is used to correct the state estimate by some amount of the difference
    between the actual measurements and the measurements predicted by the model.

    An extended Kalman filter supports nonlinear state and measurement models. It
    propagates the error covariance by linearizing the models around the state
    estimate, then applying the linear Kalman filter equations.

    """
    This class wraps an Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse latency-compensated
    vision measurements with mecanum drive encoder velocity measurements. It will
    correct for noisy measurements and encoder drift. It is intended to be an
    easy but more accurate drop-in for :class:`MecanumDriveOdometry`.

    :meth:`update` should be called every robot loop. If your loops are faster or
    slower than the default of 0.02s, then you should change the nominal delta
    time by specifying it in the constructor.

    :meth:`addVisionMeasurement` can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
    never call it, then this class will behave mostly like regular encoder
    odometry.

    The state-space system used internally has the following states (x), inputs
    (u), and outputs (y):

    :math:`x = [x, y, \theta]^T` in the field-coordinate system
    containing x position, y position, and heading.

    :math:`u = [v_x, v_y, \omega]^T` containing x velocity, y velocity,
    and angular velocity in the field-coordinate system.

    :math:`y = [x, y, \theta]^T` from vision containing x position, y
    position, and heading; or :math:`y = [theta]^T` containing gyro
    heading.
