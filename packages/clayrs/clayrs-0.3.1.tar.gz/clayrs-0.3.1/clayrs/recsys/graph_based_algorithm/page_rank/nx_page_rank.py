        tol: Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method solver.
        nstart: Starting value of PageRank iteration for each node.
        weight: Boolean value which tells the algorithm if weight of the edges must be considered or not.

        Rank the top-n recommended items for the user. If the recs_number parameter isn't specified,

        Otherwise, **ALL** unrated items will be ranked for each user.

            recs_number: number of the top ranked items to return, if None all ranked items will be returned
