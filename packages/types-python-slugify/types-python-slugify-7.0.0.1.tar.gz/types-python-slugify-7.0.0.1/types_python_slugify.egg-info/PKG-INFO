## Typing stubs for python-slugify

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `python-slugify` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `python-slugify`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/python-slugify. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `f62f402127254d3ff923da52d42fb878286cf09c`.
