  # - port: Takes `0` or `any` as any, a single number `80`, a range `200-901`, or `fragment` to match second and further fragments of fragmented packets (since there is no port available).
  #   code: same as port but makes more sense when talking about ICMP, TODO: this is not currently implemented in a way that works, use `any`
  #   proto: `any`, `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`
  #   host: `any` or a literal hostname, ie `test-host`
  #   group: `any` or a literal group name, ie `default-group`
  #   groups: Same as group but accepts a list of values. Multiple values are AND'd together and a certificate would have to contain all groups to pass
  #   cidr: a CIDR, `0.0.0.0/0` is any.
  #   ca_name: An issuing CA name
