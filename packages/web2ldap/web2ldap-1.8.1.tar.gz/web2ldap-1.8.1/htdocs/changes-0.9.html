<h1 id="r0.9.6">0.9.6</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-09-29</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Bug fixes and work arounds</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added a workaround for misbehaving LDAP servers (e.g. Lotus Domino)
        which return a single null-byte character in <var>namingContexts</var>
        attribute of RootDSE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another workaround for some weird effects if <em>python-ldap</em>
        is linked against OpenLDAP 2 libs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed race condition in <var>LDAPSession.getRootDSE()</var> which
        ended with <var>namingContexts</var> attribute having the value
        None instead of [] under some strange error conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="r0.9.5">0.9.5</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-09-23</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Installation changes</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use separately distributed module
        <a href="https://www.stroeder.com/pylib/PyWebLib/">
        PyWebLib</a> for web session handling, form processing,
        some HTTP header handling and SSL-related environment.
        Modules <var>cgiforms</var>, <var>cgisession</var>, <var>cgihelper</var>
        and <var>httphelper</var> are no longer shipped with web2ldap package.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use module <var>ldapthreadlock</var> contributed to
        <em>python-ldap</em> instead shipping own module <var>ldapthreading</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Module <var>ldif</var> is no longer shipped since
        it was contributed to <em>python-ldap</em> ages ago.
      </li>
      <li>
        Module <var>DNS</var> is no longer distributed within the package.
        Install <a href="http://pydns.sourceforge.net/">PyDNS</a>
        instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Format of host-specific parameter
        <a href="web2ldapcnf_hosts.html#addform_oc_list">addform_oc_list</a>
        has changed. The tuple now contains the attribute type for forming
        the RDN. This is pretty convenient. Use it!
      </li>
      <li>
        On Posix platforms a local configuration module (etc/web2ldap
        in start directory) now has precedence over a system-wide
        configuration module (/etc/web2ldap).
        Also getting the configuration module from Windows-specific
        system directories is not possible anymore.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>New features</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implemented very basic group management. Make sure to check out
        button [Groups] in context menu of single entry display (read).
      </li>
      <li>
        Added handling of binary attribute values stored as hex-byte
        encoding with prefix {ASN}.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>User Interface</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The bind DN (var <var>who</var>) is reused as default in login form if
        <var>ldap.INVALID_CREDENTIALS</var> was raised after login try.
      </li>
      <li>
        New quick button in <var>ConnInfo</var> for accessing
        <var>subschemaSubentry</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The old password is not requested anymore in the password
        input form. Instead a relogin window is provided if
        <var>ldap.INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS</var> is raised.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the user has to do a new login after changing his/her
        password there is no menu shown anymore.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added search option &quot;exists&quot; to
        advanced search form. The search string is ignored
        if this option is chosen.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Code cleaning and performance tuning</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Removed unused module <var>msshelve</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Removed some unnecessary module imports.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate module <var>ldaputil.passwd</var> is used to set the
        userPassword attribute instead of doing all the stuff in
        application module <var>w2lpasswd</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moved application modules <var>pylib/w2l*.py</var> to separate module
        package directory <var>pylib/w2lapp/</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code-cleaning concerning <var>w2lapp.core.CleanUpThread</var>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some code-cleaning with catching referral exceptions
        when <em>python-ldap</em> is built with OpenLDAP 2.0.x.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented new class <var>ldaputil.ldapurlLDAPUrl</var> which does
        the whole LDAP URL handling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lots of small code clean-ups, e.g. substituted lots of
        lambda, map(), filter function calls with list comprehensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dumpasn1 config file is only parsed once at startup
        and the parsed content is held persistent =&gt; tremendous
        speed-up when displaying certificates and CRLs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moved creation of modlist's for modify() calls from ldapbase
        into new sub-module ldaputil.modlist. Functions were renamed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bug fixes and work arounds</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hopefully fixed bugs with mixed-case handling of LDIF and
        other input data by rewriting <var>ldapbase.modify_modifylist()</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Proper handling of lower-cased attribute type names of special
        root DSE attributes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Catch all exceptions which might occur when calling
        <var>DNS.ParseResolvConf()</var> in module <var>ldapdns</var>
        and set ldapdns.dns_module_avail=0 in this case which switches
        off looking up SRV RRs in DNS.
        This is a rather crude approach which should be refined in
        the near future.
      </li>
      <li>
        A bunch of small fixes and clean-ups for nasty things
        detected by <var>PyChecker</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <var>utctime.strftimeiso8601()</var> does not rely on
        <var>time.strftime()</var> to display timestamps anymore.
        This makes displaying of all year values possible
        (not only 0..99,1900.. like enforced by <var>time.strftime()</var>).
      </li>
      <li>
        When retrieving the root DSE &quot;+&quot; (ASCII 43) is used as
        requested attribute type for OpenLDAP 2.0.x as described in
        <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3673">RFC 3673</a>
        if the objectClass attribute of root DSE contains 
        &quot;OpenLDAProotDSE&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed wrong definition of Mozilla-specific MIME type
        for attribute <var>certificateRevocationList</var>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="r0.9.4">0.9.4</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-06-23</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed displaying of <var>iPAddress</var> attribute in
    certificates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abandoned global configuration parameter
    <var>web2ldapcnf.misc.script_method</var>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Slightly improved exception handling especially
    of logging/ignoring user-aborted connections, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determining appropriate charset used with browser was improved:
    mainly proper parsing of capability values.
  </li>
  <li>
    A lookup of SRV RRs is automatically done if a LDAP URL
    does not contain a host name but a &quot;dc-style&quot; DN
    (a DN formed by <var>domainComponent</var> attributes).
  </li>
  <li>
    New configuration sub-module <var>fastcgi</var>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some really significant performance optimizations in
    <var>ldapthreading</var> module. Former approach in method
    <var>LDAPObject.result()</var> was brain-dead and slow.
  </li>
  <li>
    Web session ID is now passed around in PATH_INFO instead as
    a hidden form field. This means less HTML bloat and it decoupled
    session retrieving from form processing.
  </li>
  <li>
    If ldap.NAMING_VIOLATION occurs during <var>add</var>
    the user can reedit his input.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed smart login search with user names containing
    NON-ASCII chars. (sigh!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed wrong passing of parameters when calling
    function <var>ldapbase.SmartLogin()</var>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use timeout search for smart login.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="r0.9.3">0.9.3</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-06-08</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Started writing a <a href="faq.html">FAQ document</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cleaned up determining the default RDN for adding new entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an exception instance of type <var>ldap.PARTIAL_RESULTS</var>
    contains more than one referral LDAP URL only the first
    one is extracted and used. This is a workaround for the
    problem that multiple referral URLs were not parsed properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    New method <var>LDAPSession.isLeafEntry()</var> is used to prevent
    user from submitting <var>modrdn</var> request on non-leaf entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a single binary attribute is requested by command <var>read</var>
    an error message is generated if the entry does not contain this
    attribute (probably affects only cases where the user manually
    edits the URL).
  </li>
  <li>
    Some modifications to nicely display attributes found in
    Active Directory (e.g. <var>objectGUID</var>, <var>whenChanged</var>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Incompatible change to configuration dictionary
    <var>web2ldapcnf.misc.ldap_browsermimetypes</var> to make
    it more flexible. The format is now:
    <pre>
ldap_browsermimetypes = {
  ('browsername','browserversion'):{
    'attrtype':'mime_type'
  },
  'browsername':{
    'attrtype':'mime_type'
  },
}
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Default MIME-types of certificates and CRLs
    were changed to <var>application/pkix-cert</var> and
    <var>application/pkix-crl</var> to be compliant to
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2585">RFC 2585</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extra try-except block in <var>w2lhandler.py</var> sends all unhandled
    exceptions (including exceptions raised in except statements of inner
    try-except block) to logging function <var>w2lcore.log_exception()</var>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work around buggy browsers (e.g. StarOffice) which does not honour the
    <var>accept-charset</var> attribute of &lt;form&gt; tag and try
    to decode input as ISO-8859-1 if e.g. UTF-8 fails.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="r0.9.2">0.9.2</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-05-19</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Security fix:<br>
    </strong>
    When calling <var>ldapsession.LDAPSession.bind()</var>
    the LDAPSession instance (associated with the web session)
    flushes all cached data, forgets all old RootDSE
    attributes and calls <var>ldapsession.LDAPSession.getRootDSE()</var>
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Security fix:<br>
    </strong>
    Fixed determining SSL security level and displaying
    certificates from SSL-related environment vars
    in <var>conninfo</var>. (works only through FastCGI)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Security feature:<br>
    </strong>
    Reimplemented rudimental SSL-based authorization scheme
    for gateway use. (works only through FastCGI)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed handling of search scope select field when a search
    form is displayed after the user entered an invalid search filter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send HTTP error 405 in <var>msHTTPHandler</var> if running stand-alone
    and web application is accessed with HTTP-method HEAD.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adjusted some more HTTP error responses in <var>msHTTPHandler</var>
    for running stand-alone to be hopefully more compliant to
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the user enters an incomplete RDN for a new entry containing
    only the attribute type (e.g. 'cn=') and the corresponding
    attribute value is present in the entry the new RDN is
    automatically formed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Removed input form for command <var>locate</var> from entry page
    because too many people did not know what it means.
    Instead directly invoke web2ldap with URL
    <code>http://[host:port]/web2ldap/locate</code>
    to get the input form.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="r0.9.1">0.9.1</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-05-15</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a compatibility issue in method
    <var>ldapthreading.LDAPObject.result()</var> with versions of
    python-ldap based on sources prior 2000-10-19. (see the
    <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/python-ldap/python-ldap/Modules/LDAPObject.c.diff?r1=1.6%26r2=1.7">
    incompatible change made to python-ldap</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Catch an AttributeError exception when using python-ldap built
    with LDAP libs without caching option.
  </li>
  <li>
    Running multi-threaded is also the default on non-Posix
    platforms (e.g. Win32) now.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="r0.9.0">0.9.0</h1>
<p>Release Date: 2001-05-10</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Most important change:
    </strong>
    <br>
    Dropped support for running as stateless CGI-BIN or
    stateless mod_python handler. Instead the possible modes are
    running as a multi-threaded stand-alone server or as a
    multi-threaded FastCGI server.<br>
    The main benefit is that LDAPObject instances are kept persistent
    in memory =&gt; there is no need rebind for each hit anymore. This
    greatly improves performance and reduces security risks since
    the credentials do not have to be stored at all. Other benefits
    are faster session database clean-ups and avoiding problems with
    file locking, file permissions etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Web session management. Each LDAP connection object is tied
    to a session ID stored in a hidden input field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Method HTTP-POST is used wherever the state of the LDAP repository
    is changed or a login is done (to be compliant with section 9.1 of
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Slightly improved debug log by suppressing traceback
    if IOError.errno==32 (user aborted connection) and printing
    date/time and client IP address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Important security fix: Internal URL redirector.
    </strong>
    <br>
    URLs are not displayed directly anymore. The URL points
    to the new <var>urlredirect</var> command which creates
    a HTML page with &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content=&quot;0;..&gt;&quot;.
    This avoids that the browser sends the currently viewed URL as
    Referer-URL which could reveal session ID and credentials
    to an attacker.
  </li>
  <li>
    If ldap.SIZELIMIT_EXCEEDED exception is raised during
    a search the and the output format is <var>table</var> the
    partially received search results are displayed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Default configuration module in distribution is now
    platform-independent and tries to set all path names relative
    to web2ldap directory. This makes quick-install for stand-alone mode
    easy on  most platforms. Just extract archive and start the
    sbin/web2ldap.py script.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type of audio and image attributes is automatically determined
    with sndhdr and imghdr modules in Python's standard lib.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hopefully fixed template files for vCard. At least works with
    Netscape now (problem with empty attributes).
  </li>
  <li>
    Single entries are now retrieved with all binary attributes
    and placed in a short-time cache together with other LDAP
    session data. This makes it possible to correctly access
    all multi-valued binary attributes with separate buttons
    or display multi-valued image attributes in-line.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wrapper script for running as <em>FastCGI server</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Access log for stand-alone mode in combined log format (with Referrer
    and User-Agent header).
  </li>
  <li>
    Wrapper class <var>ldapthreading.LDAPObject</var>
    around <var>ldap.LDAPObject</var> (mainly for thread-locking)
    which transforms all synchronous calls into asynchronous python-ldap
    calls.
  </li>
  <li>
    Log unhandled exceptions in error log file with a lot of
    information about the aborted connection.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make use of LDAP cache of LDAP libs. Two new host-/backend-specific
    parameters <var>cache_timeout</var> and <var>cache_maxmem</var> in
    configuration module web2ldapcnf.hosts.
  </li>
  <li>
    User interface:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inline displaying of images (attribute jpegPhoto etc.)
        when displaying an entry (Read).
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;embed type=&quot;..&quot; src=&quot;..&quot;&gt; for
        &quot;displaying&quot; audio attribute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nicer displaying of operational attributes when displaying a
        single entry by using a (language variant) HTML template file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slightly improved the HTML generation, e.g. more consequent use
        of &lt;fieldset&gt; sections, lower-cased HTML tags and
        attributes etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        If ldap.OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION, ldap.OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION or
        problems with RDN occurs during add (or modify) it
        is now possible for the user to edit his input again.
      </li>
      <li>
        If ldap.FILTER_ERROR exception is raised during a search the
        user can edit the search filter and re-submit it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Currently viewed DN is not changed if a new entry was added.
        This hopefully makes it easier to repeatedly add entries below
        the same node.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <var>[Display All]</var> button for immediate switching to unpaged
        displaying of search results.
      </li>
      <li>
        OIDs in RootDSE attributes are displayed with name and description.
        Credits go to Norbert Klasen for contributing a comprehensive list.
      </li>
      <li>
        More information in connection info (ConnInfo).
      </li>
      <li>
        Buttons for quickly choosing default object classes
        of new entries. This list is configurable per host/backend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quick buttons for accessing RootDSE, CN=MONITOR and CN=CONFIG
        in context menu of connection info (ConnInfo).
      </li>
      <li>
        New command <var>monitor</var> which displays general
        gateway statistics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved documentation of configuration module package
        <a href="web2ldapcnf.html">web2ldapcnf</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Bug fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Configuration did not work properly since 0.8.0 because I dropped
        ldap_basedn in hidden fields. Fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed parsing of LDAP URLs. Bug was related to usage of
        new string methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed the screwed up passwd changing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check if RDN in input is empty or RDN has wrong format
        before adding entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed Unicode handling in ldapbase.SearchTree() (used for
        recursive deleting of entries).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed displaying of missing parent entry DNs when adding an entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many small HTML generation fixes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many, many small fixes...and probably new bugs... ;-)
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed handling of LDIF input data (was case-sensitive regarding
        the attribute types).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Code cleaning:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dropped support for checking gateway use by looking
        at DN of the client certificates. It seems that nobody
        is using it and it was getting ugly (may appear again in
        later version).
      </li>
      <li>
        A lot of connection stuff is done within ldapsession.LDAPSession
        objects now including storing and restoring sessions and
        getting RootDSE attributes like namingContexts etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        LDAP sessions are wrapped in LDAPSession objects for
        pickling and to wrap specific details if a patched python-ldap
        built against OpenLDAP 2.0.x libs is in use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rewrote parts of module w2lhandler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call login form directly if password of currently
        used bind DN was changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code for creating the input forms for adding and
        modifying entries was a complete mess. It's still not pretty...
      </li>
      <li>
        The code for creating the search forms was also a complete mess.
      </li>
      <li>
        w2lgui.DisplayDN now took over all weird things with
        displaying DNs.
      </li>
      <li>
       Moved class <var>HTTPHandler</var> from module <var>msHTTPServer</var>
       into separate module <var>msHTTPHandler</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating hidden fields along with buttons is simplified by
        new parameter hidden_fields (list of tuples) in function
        <var>w2lgui.CommandButton()</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Almost no direct calls of LDAPObject methods anymore. All necessary
        methods are wrapped in sort of higher level wrapper
        methods of LDAPSession class. This makes caching and locking
        feasible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Handle more input field stuff with the fine <var>cgiforms</var>
        module and derived classes in module <var>w2lgui</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cleaned up function <var>httphelper.SendHeader()</var>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
