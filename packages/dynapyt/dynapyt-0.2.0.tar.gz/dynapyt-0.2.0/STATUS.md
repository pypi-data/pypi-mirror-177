Evaluated - Functional

We are applying to obtain the "Evaluated - Functional" badge for DynaPyt.
The installation procedure, instrumenting code, and running the analysis are all documented.
Moreover, several analyses are implemented and included in this repository as guiding examples for analysis developers.
Analysis hooks are also well-documented both inside the code, and in the accompanying document.
We have also provided a simple script to run end-to-end experiments from the paper to reduce the hassle of reproducing the results.
