# PHAL Linear LED Plugin
Enables interaction with LEDs in a one-dimensional physical arrangement.

## Configuration
For Neopixel devices, the plugin requires `root` permissions and must be enabled
explicitly in the system configuration in `/etc`.
```yaml
PHAL:
  admin:
    neon-phal-plugin-linear-led-neopixel:
      enabled: true
```
>*Note*: If any other config is present here (i.e. colors), it will override 
> all configuration in `PHAL.neon-phal-plugin-linear-led` for Neopixel devices.
> It is recommended to not include config here so that it applies to all linear
> LED classes.

### Colors
By default, the plugin will use theme colors for different events, but these
colors may also be overridden in configuration.
```yaml
PHAL:
  neon-phal-plugin-linear-led:
    listen_color: white
    mute_color: burnt_orange
    sleep_color: red
```

## messagebus API
This plugin exposes messagebus listener `neon.linear_led.show_animation` to 
trigger showing an animation. Any skill, plugin, or other integration can 
request an LED ring animation by emitting a Message:
```python
from mycroft_bus_client import Message

Message("neon.linear_led.show_animation",
        {'animation': 'chase',
         'color': 'green',
         'timeout': 10})
```

Note that the plugin may enforce a limit to how long the animation is displayed
and also may replace the animation with a different one that is triggered.
