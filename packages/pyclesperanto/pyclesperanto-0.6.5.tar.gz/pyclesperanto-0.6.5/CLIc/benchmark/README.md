# Benchmarking CLIc
This is the result of a small student project.

To create a new benchmark have a look at `benchmark_mean.cpp` or `benchmark_dummy.cpp`.
More complicated examples are `benchmark_means_comparison.cpp` and `benchmark_maximum_projections.cpp`.

To build the benchmarks build the main project with `BUILD_BENCHMARK` set to `ON`.

Keep in mind that your new benchmark has to be added manually to this directories `CMakeLists.txt`.
