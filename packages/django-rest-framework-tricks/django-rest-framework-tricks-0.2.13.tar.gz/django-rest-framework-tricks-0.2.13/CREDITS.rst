Original idea
-------------
The package has been started as a single trick for making the nested
serializers easier in Django REST framework. Idea of setting dummy field
on a model level and making a dynamic property of it came out as a result of
collaborative efforts of Artur Barseghyan (author of this package) and
`Peter Uittenbroek <https://github.com/puittenbroek>`_.
