    Load a graph from an edgelist file.

    We define an edgelist file in the following way.
      - Any lines beginning with '#' or '//' are ignored
      - Any blank lines are ignored
      - All other lines are of some format:
          <u>, <v>, <weight>
          <u>, <v>
          <u> <v> <weight>
          <u> <v>
        where <u> and <v> can be parsed as integers, and <weight> can be parsed
        as a double. If the weight is ommitted, it is taken to be 1. The
        data lines of the edgelist file should all have the same format.
