This is an unofficial release that aims to make a recent version of pywatchman
available to python projects.

Specifically, Django depends on pywatchman to have a modern autoreload process,
but recent changes to the core watchman process has meant that the latest offical
release of pywatchman (2017 - v1.4.2) no longer works. Luckily, Django falls back
to the slower StatReloader, but we've found that to have unacceptable performance
in large projects.

The Facebook response to issues, particularly on the pywatchman sub-project, has
been underwhelming for years. I do not plan to maintain this unofficial release
for a long period of time, but hopefully seeing that it *is* possible to build
and publish a release will trigger some renewed interest.

Use at your own risk.
