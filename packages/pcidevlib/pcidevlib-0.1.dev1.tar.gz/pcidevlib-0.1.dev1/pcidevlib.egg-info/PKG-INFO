# PCI Device library

Get device info + read from /dev/mem accordingly for the device MMIO memory allocation.

This project has intention to develop the right tools to develop many of the necessary stuff
from BCM43XX devices.

Library won't work for any other type of devices (PCIe, ...) only for PCI, as are the Network
devices from the Broadcom BCM43XX chipsets.

## Contributing

Right now I don't have the intention of accepting PRs from outside the people working in this project. (Me and my professors for the moment I guess 😬).

If anything, feel free to contact me.
