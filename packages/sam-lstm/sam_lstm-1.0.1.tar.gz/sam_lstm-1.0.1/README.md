## Abstract

Data-driven saliency has recently gained a lot of attention thanks to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting gaze fixations. In this paper we go beyond standard approaches to saliency prediction, in which gaze maps are computed with a feed-forward network, and we present a novel model which can predict accurate saliency maps by incorporating neural attentive mechanisms. The core of our solution is a Convolutional LSTM that focuses on the most salient regions of the input image to iteratively refine the predicted saliency map. Additionally, to tackle the center bias present in human eye fixations, our model can learn a set of prior maps generated with Gaussian functions. We show, through an extensive evaluation, that the proposed architecture overcomes the current state of the art on two public saliency prediction datasets. We further study the contribution of each key components to demonstrate their robustness on different scenarios.

## Requirements
* Python 3.9
* OpenCV 4.6.0
* tensorflow/keras 2.9.0

## Setting up the environment
### Keras (WINDOWS)
1. Go to `%USERPROFILE%` directory on Windows and create a folder `.keras`.
2. Inside it, create `keras.json` with the following content -
### Keras (LINUX)
```
cd ~/.keras
echo '{"floatx": "float32",\
"epsilon": 1e-07,\
"backend": "tensorflow",\
"image_data_format": "channels_first"}' > keras.json
```
## Usage
```python
from sam import SalMap
salmap = SalMap()
salmap.compile()
salmap.load_weights(weights_path="/weights/sam-resnet_salicon_weights.pkl")
salmap.test(samples_dir="/samples")
```

## Precomputed Saliency Maps
We provide saliency maps predicted by SAM-VGG and SAM-ResNet for three standard datasets (SALICON, MIT1003 and CAT2000):
* **[SAM-VGG predictions](https://github.com/marcellacornia/sam/releases/download/1.0/sam-vgg_predictions.zip)**
* **[SAM-ResNet predictions](https://github.com/marcellacornia/sam/releases/download/1.0/sam-resnet_predictions.zip)**

In addition, we provide saliency maps predicted by SAM-ResNet on the new release of the SALICON dataset:
* **[SAM-ResNet predictions (SALICON 2017)](https://github.com/marcellacornia/sam/releases/download/1.0/sam-resnet_predictions_salicon2017.zip)**
