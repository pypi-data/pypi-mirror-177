class CountMinSketch(object):
    """
    A class for counting hashable items using the Count-min Sketch strategy.
    It fulfills a similar purpose than `itertools.Counter`.
    The Count-min Sketch is a randomized data structure that uses a constant
    amount of memory and has constant insertion and lookup times at the cost
    of an arbitrarily small overestimation of the counts.
    It has two parameters:
     - `m` the size of the hash tables, larger implies smaller overestimation
     - `d` the amount of hash tables, larger implies lower probability of
           overestimation.
    An example usage:
        from countminsketch import CountMinSketch
        sketch = CountMinSketch(1000, 10)  # m=1000, d=10
        sketch.add("oh yeah")
        sketch.add(tuple())
        sketch.add(1, value=123)
        print sketch["oh yeah"]       # prints 1
        print sketch[tuple()]         # prints 1
        print sketch[1]               # prints 123
        print sketch["non-existent"]  # prints 0
    Note that this class can be used to count *any* hashable type, so it's
    possible to "count apples" and then "ask for oranges". Validation is up to
    the user.
