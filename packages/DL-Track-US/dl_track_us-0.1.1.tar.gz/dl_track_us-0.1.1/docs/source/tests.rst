DL_Track Testing
================

We have provided detailed instructions for testing the DL_Track python package in the DL_Track_tests.pdf file. The file is located in the `tests <https://github.com/PaulRitsche/DLTrack/tree/main/tests>`_ directory in our Github repository. We have not yet included unit tests for the DL_Track python package.
