"""
This module is a cache for Records where we checked the existence in a remote server using
identifiables. If the Record was found, this means that we identified the corresponding Record
in the remote server and the ID of the local object can be set.
To prevent querying the server again and again for the same objects, this cache allows storing
Records that were found on a remote server and those that were not (typically in separate caches).
The look up in the cache is done using a hash of a string representation.

TODO: We need a general review:
- How are entities identified with each other?
- What happens if the identification fails?

Checkout how this was done in the old crawler.
