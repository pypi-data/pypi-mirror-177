<p> Detoxification is a natural process that happens in the human body to get rid of harmful substances known as toxins. The buildup of toxins can lead to an imbalance in the body, giving rise to diseases. Our bodies have the capacity to rid of these harmful substances through detoxification pathways. Detoxification has a significant impact on human health. </p>

<p> There are two types of toxins in the body: </p>
<p><strong>Exogenous Toxins</strong> These are absorbed by the body from external sources like water, air, food, or direct contact. Drugs, chemicals, and microorganisms are examples of exogenous toxins. </p>

<p><strong>Endogenous Toxins</strong>: These toxins are produced in the body as by-products of metabolism. Endogenous toxins also include the metabolic by-products of the bacteria that live in our bodies. </p>

<p> Impaired detoxification can be harmful to the body. </p>
<ul>
<li> Toxins can get collected in adipose or fatty tissue, making weight loss harder. </li>
<li> A buildup of toxins in the body can lead to fatigue and irregular sleep patterns. </li>
<li> Toxin buildup can also lead to infrequent bowel movements. </li>
<li> When the liver detoxification does not occur properly, the toxins might be eliminated through the skin through sweat and this can lead to several skin problems like rashes, or eczema. </li>
<li> Toxin buildup can also lead to gallbladder problems as the gallbladder functions closely with the liver. </li>
</ul>

<p> Detoxification occurs in three phases: </p>
<ul>
<li> Phase 1 Detoxification - Bioactivation </li>
<li> Phase 2 Detoxification - Conjugation </li>
<li> Phase 3 Detoxification - Antiporter Activity </li>
</ul>

<p> Each phase is governed by different sets of enzymes. In phase 1 and phase 2, the enzymes modify the toxins to a form that supports easy elimination in phase 3. </p>

<p> Certain changes in the genes that produce these enzymes can cause differences in the amount of enzymes produced. This can directly affect the detoxification process. </p>

<p>In this report, we profile gene variants associated with the detoxification process. This report is aimed to help you support your body with the right nutrition and supplements for optimal detoxification. </p>
