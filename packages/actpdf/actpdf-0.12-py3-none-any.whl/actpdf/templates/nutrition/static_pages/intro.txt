Have you ever wondered why some people gain weight on a high-carb diet, and others do not? And why
some people cannot consume milk and other dairy products without experiencing uneasiness? Do you
want to know which diet is the most optimal for you? The answer may lie in your genes.

The way we fuel our bodies with the foods we eat is impacted by our genetic make-up. The old adage;
you are what you eat, plays a major role in influencing our health and well-being. Food and its nutrients,
directly and indirectly influence our gene expressions. Genetic variations affecting certain metabolic
traits influence dietary requirements. For instance, the response to carbohydrates varies from individual
to individual, explaining why some people eat all the pizzas they want without gaining weight. These
factors may be attributed to the large role that genes play in influencing eating behaviors and the
metabolism of different foods.

Some interesting facts about genes and nutrition:

+ Craig Maclean, the famous track cyclist and Olympics gold medalist, and Novak Djokovic, the
famous tennis player, were both diagnosed with celiac disease (a severe form of gluten
intolerance) and owed their success to a gluten-free diet.
+ A study on weight management conducted by Stanford University found that people who eat and
exercise according to their genetic type tend to lose two-and-a-half times as much weight as
compared to those who do not.
+ Approximately 74% of Native Americans, 90% of Asian Americans, 70% of African Americans, and
53% of Mexican Americans are lactose intolerant. Research shows that there is a considerable
reduction in lactase activity among people whose ancestry is of Greek, Italian, Arab, Asian,
African, Hispanic, or Jewish origin.
+ According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 43% of children and 38% of
pregnant women suffer from iron deficiency, 1 in 6 women suffer from vitamin A deficiency, and
17.3% of the global population has zinc deficiency.
+ Fast metabolizers of caffeine, who drink up to 3 cups of coffee per day, have almost 52% lower
risk of heart attack as compared to slow metabolizers.

In this report, we profile genes that have been shown to influence nutritional traits like diet and weight
management, micronutrient requirements, food intolerance, and several other attributes relevant to
nutritional well-being.

We hope that this report will help you understand your body better and align your diet to your genetic
type for the best results.
