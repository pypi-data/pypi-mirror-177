The skin is the largest sensory organ in the body and the most noticed one! There are numerous
external factors like the environment and your skincare routine which affect your skin, but apart from
that, there is a significant association between your genes your skin health and beauty.

About 2 million years ago, early hominids shed their hair and exposed their pale skin to the sun-
drenched savanna of Africa. Natural selection favored those with darker skin tone as it protected against
the UV radiation that caused cancer. About 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, our ancestors who migrated to
Northern Climates did not need the protection and evolved their pale skin back. In regions with less
sunshine, there was a natural selection for lighter skin, as it meant that they were able to absorb more
sunlight to make vitamin D.

Genetics has shown that every person is unique and so is the care required for their skin, which is why
your friend probably tans faster than you when you are at the beach together. Analyzing your genetic
data will provide practical information that can be used by your dermatologist to develop a personalized
skincare routine.

* 8 sites in the human genome are associated with 30% variation in skin pigmentation
* 81% of acne prevalence is influenced by genes. A first degree relative with acne increases risk by
4 times
* The age at which you notice wrinkles and their severity depend on genes. 60% of skin aging is
influenced by genes
* 20 to 30% of atopic dermatitis patients have an FLG gene variation
* A child with a sibling with psoriasis is 4 to 6 times more likely to get it
* The risk of developing varicose veins is 90% for children with affected parents.

Gene variations are partly responsible for skin type. Other factors include environmental triggers, stress,
and diet. In this report, we profile genes that are associated with the risk for various skin conditions and
signs of skin damage.

We hope this report helps you understand your skin better, and helps you nourish and care for your skin
better.
