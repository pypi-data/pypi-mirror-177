## *Understanding your report* {: .ui .center .aligned .header .big2}

### Human health is a complex interplay between genetics and environment (lifestyle, diet, activity, stress, etc.). Your genes, training and diet, all play a vital role in your overall fitness.

This report is presented in a user friendly language and format. The following tips will help you get the best information value out of the report.

**1. The word "likely" is used often in the report. What does it mean?**

People generally know that high cholesterol can lead to heart conditions. However, there are individuals with high cholesterol who do not
develop heart disease. Similarly, smoking can lead to lung disease, but not always. Hence, certain genetic parameters can lead to certain
outcomes but other factors may modify the outcome. "Likely" means, it is more likely that one will see the outcome, but other factors may modify it.

**2. What does the term "average" mean in the report?**

Average implies neither high nor low, rather an intermediate outcome. For example, average likelihood of injury is an intermediate level
between high and low likelihood. Average can also be understood in the context of "Normal" or "Typical" or "Moderate"

**3. How do I know which result is applicable to me?**

Only results with a check mark <i class="positive checkmark icon"></i>, <i class="red exclamation circle icon"></i> and <i class="orange exclamation triangle icon"></i>
are applicable to you, the others are not applicable. All possible outcomes are provided in the table
to provide a context to your outcome.

**4. Where did the information contained in the report come from?**

The genetic markers that are used in this report are based on scientific studies published in international journals. A list of references is
available for you to read on our web blog.

**5. Some genes indicate beneficial and some non-beneficial for the same outcome, why?**

Itâ€™s estimated that there are around 20,000 to 30,000 genes in the human body. Most of the human body functions are regulated by
several genes, not one. Humans have a combination of favorable and unfavorable genes for the same trait. "Your Outcome" indicates an
overall outcome from all of the genes. Please note that, not all genes contribute equally towards the trait, hence, pay attention to
individual gene outcomes as well and see which one is closely aligned to your own observations about yourself. Olympics athletes, for
example, are likely to carry many more gene variants that are favorable, than unfavorable for their sport.

**6. Some sentences are colored in green and others in red, why?**

Attributes that are advantageous for sports fitness are indicated in green and those that are not advantageous are in red. Neutral
outcomes are indicated in black. But do remember, what is an advantage in one thing could be a disadvantage in another and vice versa.
For example, generally, being flexible is an advantage, but not so for sprint runners, where inflexibility favours superior performance.
