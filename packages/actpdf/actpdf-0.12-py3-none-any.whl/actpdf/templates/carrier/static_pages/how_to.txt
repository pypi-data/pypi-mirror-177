This report is presented in a user-friendly language and format. The following tips will help you get the
best information value out of the report.

**1. What is the source of the information contained in this report?**

The pathogenicity potential of the identified variants were assessed by considering the predicted
consequence, the biochemical properties of the codon change and the degree of evolutionary
conservation as well as a number of reference population databases and mutation databases such as,
but not limited, to the 1000 Genomes Project, gnomAD, ClinVar, ExAC, The American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and HGMD.

**2. How seriously should I take this information?**

All medical tests which are intended for use in diagnosing and treating medical conditions, whether or
not genetic, must be prescribed and interpreted by your doctor. Ancestry tests seldom fulfill the
stringency criteria required for medical diagnosis and treatment. Your doctor will order clinical
sequencing for medical purposes. You or your physician can upload a wide variety of data formats
ranging from Genotyping files to whole-genome files on our website. The depth and reliability of the
information depend on the source file uploaded.

**3. What does pathogenic mean?**

The word pathogenic generally means disease-causing. Likely pathogenic means likely disease-
causing.

**4. What does conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity mean?**

Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity means that some researchers have found this variant to be
pathogenic while others have not. This variant is neither pathogenic nor benign.Your physician will
determine how to interpret this variant.

**5. What does unknown signficance mean?**
It means the clinical or health significance of that specific variant is not yet known.
