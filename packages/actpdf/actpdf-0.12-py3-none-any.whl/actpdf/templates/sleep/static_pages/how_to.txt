This report is presented in a user friendly language and format. The following tips will help you get the
best information value out of the report.

People generally know that high cholesterol can lead to heart conditions. However, there are individuals
with high cholesterol who do not develop heart disease. Similarly, smoking can lead to lung disease, but

modify the outcome. "Likely" means, it is more likely that one will see the outcome, but other factors may
modify it.

Normal implies an average outcome. For example, normal tendency for insomnia risk is the average
genetic likelihood of developing insomnia.
