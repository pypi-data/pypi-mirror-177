Are you an introvert? Anxious about a date? Or often worried about things? Behavioral genetics has
shown that there is a significant heritability for personality traits. The knowledge about the genetic
variants you carry will help you understand yourself better and enhance and develop aspects of your
personality.

Some people seem to be predisposed to being open and outgoing, while others exhibit a more reserved
disposition. A commonly noticeable attribute among individuals is their predisposition to extroversion or
introversion. Clearly, while some people enjoy or even seek attention and seem to be natural extroverts,
some are the opposite. Nature may have intended for individuals of different personalities to play
different roles, as demonstrated by the following passage.

Researchers from UC Santa Barbara studied 600 adult members of an isolated indigenous population in
central Bolivia, the Tsimane, and found that men who were outgoing and open were associated with
having more children. Extroverts tend to be more relaxed during social gatherings, having more fun with
friends and taking risks, which may be rewarding as well as dangerous. A study conducted by
researchers from the University of Newcastle showed that extroverts were more likely to be injured due
to the increased risk of conflicts. On the other hand, introverts tend to be more careful and astute,
learning from other peopleâ€™s actions rather than their own. From an evolutionary aspect, while extroverts
helped in increasing the kind, introverts helped in preserving.

Some interesting facts about genes and personality traits:

+ 34 to 47% variance in empathy is genetic
+ 24% variance in leadership potential is genetic
+ 50% of entrepreneurship ability is due to genetic factors
+ 20% of the variation in educational attainment is genetic
+ 67% of anger trait variation is associated with genetic variability
+ 33% variation in life satisfaction is associated with genetic variation


In this report, we profile genes that have been shown to influence personality traits like leadership
potential, empathy, extroversion, entrepreneurship, maths ability, and several other attributes 
relevant toinnate character and personality.

Quoting the famous scientist Albert Einstein, who was an introvert himself, "Everybody is a genius. But if
you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life thinking it is stupid."

We hope that this report will help you understand yourself better and enhance your best attributes and
help you improve on areas that may need improving upon.
