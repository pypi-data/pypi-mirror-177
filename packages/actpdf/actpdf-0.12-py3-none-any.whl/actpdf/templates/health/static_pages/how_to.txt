    This is not a medical diagnostic report. Ancestry tests are not clinically certified and
should not be used for medical purposes. The health outcomes presented in this report
are influenced by the number of markers present in your genome raw data, which differs
significantly between companies.

**1. What does it mean to have a high genetic tendency for a health condition?**

It is generally know that high cholesterol can lead to heart conditions. However, there are individuals
with high cholesterol who do not develop heart disease. Similarly, genetic factors may increase the risk
for a particular condition but the individual may not always develop the condition during his/her lifetime. 
Though there are over 50 gene risk variations which have identified for heart disease, they only account
for 10% of the heritable risk for heart disease. Moreover, genetic factors could increase the risk for
certain health conditions but other factors may modify the risk, which is why the outcomes are termed as
"likely" and not definitive.

**2. What do the various terms used in the report mean?**

**Gene markers analyzed:** The number of gene markers that are being considered to evaluate the
outcome for a specific condition.

**Gene markers present in your genome raw data:** This represents the number of gene markers from
the gene markers analyzed that are present in your genome raw data.

**Gene risk variants detected in your genome data:** This represents the number of gene markers with
the risk genotype that are present in your genome raw data

**3. What is the most appropriate way to interpret genetic results?**

Only a few human health conditions are dependent on a single gene marker. The vast majority of human
traits are influenced by multiple gene markers. In addition, there is a significant interaction between your
genes and your environmental factors such as dietary and lifestyle factors. The best way to consider the
information presented in this genetic report or any other non-clinical genetic report is to look for
corroborating evidence to the genetic report outcome. If symptoms or family history or blood report data
confirm the outcome of the genetic report, then you may consult your physician for further diagnosis of
the condition.

**4. How was my outcome estimated?**

Your outcome is a theoretically calculated measure and not a clinial measure. It is the percentage of risk
markers present in your genome data of the maximum possible risk markers in your genome data.

**5. My risk for most health conditions is mild or moderately elevated, how do I interpret this?**
We analyze a large number of risk variants and calculate a Genetic Risk Score (GRS). Unless you have
several of these high risk variants present in your data, you will see mildly or moderately elevated as the outcome.
