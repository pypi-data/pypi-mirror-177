#### Human health is a complex interplay between genetics and environment (lifestyle, diet, activity, stress and other triggers). Your genes and environmental factors play a vital role in your health and well-being.

This is not a medical diagnostic report <br><br>
Ancestry tests are not clinically certified and should not be used for medical purposes<br><br>

The health outcomes presented in this report are determined by the number of markers present in your
genome raw data, which differs significantly between companies. Genetic Research is an emerging field and
the genetic basis of many health conditions is yet to be fully established.

<p style="font-size:10px;">
This report is presented in a user friendly language and format. The following tips will help you get the best information value out of it.
</p>

**1. What does it mean to have a high genetic tendency for a health condition?**

<p style="font-size:10px;">
It is generally know that high cholesterol can lead to heart conditions. However, there are individuals with high cholesterol who do not
develop heart disease. Similarly, genetic factors may increase the risk for a particular condition but the individual may not always develop
the condition during his/her lifetime. Though there are over 50 gene risk variations which have identified for heart disease, they only
account for 10% of the heritable risk for heart disease. Moreover, genetic factors could increase the risk for certain health conditions but
other factors may modify the risk, which is why the outcomes are termed as “likely” and not definitive.

**2. What do the various terms used in the report mean?**

**Gene markers analyzed:** <small>
The number of gene markers that are being considered to evaluate the outcome for a specific condition.</small>

**Gene markers present in your genome raw data:** <small>
This represents the number of gene markers from the gene markers analyzed that are
present in your genome raw data.</small>

**Gene risk variants detected in your genome data:** <small>
This represents the number of gene markers with the risk genotype that are present in
your genome raw data</small>

**3. What is the most appropriate way to interpret genetic results?**


<p style="font-size:10px;">
Only a few human health conditions are dependent on a single gene marker. The vast majority of human traits are influenced by multiple
gene markers. In addition, there is a significant interaction between your genes and your environmental factors such as dietary and
lifestyle factors. The best way to consider the information presented in this genetic report or any other non-clinical genetic report is to
look for corroborating evidence to the genetic report outcome. If symptoms or family history or blood report data confirm the outcome
of the genetic report, then you may consult your physician for further diagnosis of the condition.</p>

**4. Where did the information contained in the report come from?**


<p style="font-size:10px;">
The genetic markers that are used in this report are based on scientific studies published in international journals. A list of references is
available for you to read on our web blog.</p>

**5. How was my outcome estimated?**


<p style="font-size:10px;">
Your outcome is a subjective measure and not a clinial measure. It is the percentage of risk markers present in your genome data among
the maximum possible risk markers in your genome data. Please bear in mind that this is a subjective measure and not a clinically
validated measure.</p>

**6. My risk for most health conditions is mild or moderately elevated, how do I interpret this?**


<p style="font-size:10px;">
We analyze a large number of risk variants and calculate a Genetic Risk Score (GRS). Unless you have several of these high risk variants
present in your data, you will see mildly or moderately elevated as the outcome.</p>
