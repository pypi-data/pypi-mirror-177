This is not a diagnostic report. This report is to be interpreted only by a Physician. Your physician will consider the genetic predispositions
indicated in this report in the context of all other information available to him about you, including biomedical data, family history,
lifestyle and other information. The conditions profiled in this report are mainly polygenic â€“ meaning a single gene mutation does not
determine the health outcome. Rather, several genes may be influencing the outcome. This report is not exhaustive. There are potentially
other genes and other mutations within the same gene that influence the particular traits listed in this report. Outcomes are highly likely
to be influenced by your ethnicity and environmental considerations such as lifestyle. Like any test, genotyping tests also carry the
possibility of errors in testing and reporting. This genetic test is not yet considered as medically necessary and is undertaken at the
discretion of the client who wishes to learn more about his/her genetic type. Ancestry test data is not considered suitable for medical
purposes. This report is for information purposes only. This report is not fit for medical purposes.
