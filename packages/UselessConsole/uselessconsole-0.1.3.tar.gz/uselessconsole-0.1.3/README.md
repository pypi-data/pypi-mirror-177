# Console Package

Why the actual fuck are you using this. All it does is prints to the console, which for you noobs out there, can be done with "print()" rather than this. The only thing that is good about this is you C# programmers can feel right at home with "Console.WriteLine()".

Please, don't use this unless you're a C# programmer who despises Python syntax.

HOW TO USE (full tutorial):

1. Install
2. Add this to your code: "from UselessConsole import Console"
3. use it lol

in this version (0.1.3) i fixed Console.WriteLine so it makes new line
