Tree Locations
----------
DataSF graciously hosts the entire data set of trees maintained by the Department of Public Works here: 
https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nqq

This data was filtered for plum trees on side walks for more manageable search and geolocations were added to trees 
with addresses that were missing them
