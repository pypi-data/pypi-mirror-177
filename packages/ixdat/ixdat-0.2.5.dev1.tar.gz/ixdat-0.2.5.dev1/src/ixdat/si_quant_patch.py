    This method adds CalPoints in the calibration for each new tracked isotope. It

    the same.

    The isotopes have to be treated as different molecules, or they will end up on the
      same row of a SensitivityMatrix, convoluting their quantification. This means
      that the `mol` attribute of their CalPoints must indicate the isotope, here
      done with "@" and the mass.

      calibration are in its MoleculeDict, Molecules of the new name must be added to
