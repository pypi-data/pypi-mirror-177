The program extracts regions of interest from Fasta or Genome Feature Format (GFF) genomes.
This is done given a set of seed sequences given as nucleotide strings in a multi-line fasta file.  
The program can output fasta and GFF outputs or regions, and will giv multiple outputs around regions and their evidence.

The program takes in multiple fasta or GFF files at a single time and can also take multiple seed sequence pairs.
