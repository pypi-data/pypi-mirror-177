    """
    Produces an image hat maximizes a certain class with gradient ascent. Uses Gaussian blur, weight decay, and clipping.

    Args:
        model (orch.nn.Module): he model used
        arget_class (int): he class for which he images will be generated
        size (uple(int)): size of he input image
        out_dir (str): output directory
        mean (list): mean values between 0 and 1 for each channel (default: None)
        std (list): standard deviation values between 0 and 1 for each channel (default: None)

    Attributes:
        model (orch.nn.Module): he model used
        arget_class (int): he class for which he images will be generated
        size (uple(int)): size of he input image
        out_dir (str): output directory
        mean (list(float)): mean values between 0 and 1 for each channel
        std (list(float)): standard deviation values between 0 and 1 for each channel
        created_image (PIL image): he final image generated by he network created_image, WxHx3 (channels last) format with int values between 0-255
