Zetane Engine is a 3D environment for exploring machine learning 
algorithms visually. Send your input, model state, and outputs at 
the same time to a visualization to get context on what is happening. 
Use breakpoints to visually debug scripts and models, record data 
and model internals, and share data + model packages with other users.
