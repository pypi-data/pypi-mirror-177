The utilities are also intended to act as building blocks for tool development in the TLA+ ecosystem.\n\n### What can it do right now?\n\nCurrently there is a cli and library functions implementing utilities:\n\n- [x] Run [TLC](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus) model checker without side effects (runs in temporary directory and is cleaned up)\n- [x] Run [TLC](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus) model checker programmatically (reads and returns json data)\n- [x] Run [Apalache](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache) model checker without side effects (runs in temporary directory and is cleaned up)\n- [x] Run [Apalache](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache) model checker programmatically (reads and returns json data)\n- [x] Extract traces from TLC output in [Informal Trace Format](https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/adr/015adr-trace.html?highlight=trace%20format#the-itf-format) format (concise and machine readable counterexample representation)\n\nAllowing clean programmatic access to model checkers and other utility.\n\n### What will it do in the future?\n\nThe model-based testing capabilities developed at Informal are currently in the [modelator](https://github.com/informalsystems/modelator) tool and are being migrated to a multi language architecture. Please expect more utilities and more tooling soon.\n\n## Usage\n\nPlease see [usage](./samples/usage.md).\n\n## Running the code in this repository\n\nPlease see [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2021 Informal Systems Inc. and modelator authors.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use the files in this repository except in compliance with the License.
