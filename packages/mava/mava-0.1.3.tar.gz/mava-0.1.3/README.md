## MAVA
A simple dataclass like model, that can be adapted for multiple purposes. It can be used pretty easily with any DB and become an ORM/ODM.
# Local installation
Run `./install.sh`.

## Notes
Models cannot have attributes that start with '_' or with a capital letter.

>Note: It's already working, but need some time to add docs.
