An integrated optimization environment (IOE) for AutoOR in Python!

## üêçIntroduction

FelooPy (FEasible, LOgical & OPtimal + Python) is a hyper-optimization interface that allows operations research scientists to build, develop, and test optimization models with almost all open-source and commercial solvers available. With FelooPy, the users would be able to benchmark the solvers to see if they meet the requirements.

Motivated by the AutoML era, which is "the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development," FelooPy is the first package that is going to provide an AutoOR tool for automating the time-consuming tasks of modeling, implementing, and analyzing an optimization model by providing an integrated (exact and heuristic) optimization environment in Python. Accordingly, FelooPy would also support multiple features such as sensitivity analysis, visualization, and more!

- Automating operations research model development workflow.
- Straightforward syntax for optimization modeling.
- Using only one syntax for coding.
- Having access to multiple optimization interfaces all at once.
- Using almost all solvers available.
- Getting execution time of your optimization model.
- Native support for sensitivity analysis.
- Native support for benchmarking all optimizers for your_model.
- Native support for heuristic optimization with the same syntax.
- Native support for solver interfaces (Coming soon)
- Native support for multi-objective optimization (Coming soon)

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

There are multiple ways to install this Python package:

- Using the command `pip install feloopy` in a terminal.
- Using the command `!pip install feloopy` at the top of your code and implementing it for once.
- Using the following piece of code:

```python
import os
os.system("pip install feloopy")
```

- Using the following function:

```python
import pip

def install(package):
    if hasattr(pip, 'main'):
        pip.main(['install', package])
    else:
        pip._internal.main(['install', package])

install('feloopy')
```

- Using the package provided in the release section.

- Using the following code (Attention: A pre-release version will be downloaded and installed.):

```python
pip install -U git+https://github.com/ktafakkori/feloopy
```
