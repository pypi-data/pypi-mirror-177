    UpFront (base.Librarian): all nodes are created at the beginning of a 
        project and stored in a repository for when they are needed. This method 
        is the fastest.
    AsNeeded (base.Librarian): nodes are created the first time that they are 
        needed and then stored in a repository of they are needed again. This 
        method balances speed and memory usage.
    OnlyAsNeeded (base.Librarian): nodes are created only when needed and need 
        to be recreated if needed again. This method conserves memory the best.
