Contents:
    Waterfall (nodes.Worker): a pre-planned, rigid workflow structure.
    Kanban (nodes.Worker): a sequential workflow with isolated stages
        that produce deliverables for the following stage.
    Scrum (nodes.Worker): flexible workflow structure that requires
        greater user control and intervention.
    Pert (nodes.Worker): workflow that focuses on efficient use of 
        parallel resources, including identifying the critical path.
    Study (nodes.Worker, abc.ABC): base class for workflows that
         integrate criteria.
