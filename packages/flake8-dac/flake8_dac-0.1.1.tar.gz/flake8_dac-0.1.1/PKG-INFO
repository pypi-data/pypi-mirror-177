## Installation

```
pip install flake8-dac
```

## Usage

```
flake8 [args] | flake8-dac
```

## Why?

I wrote it for myself when I had to implement flake8 into an existing project that had many problems. I find it helpful when I have problems grouped by the same type of cause. I can easily determine which problems I can ignore, and then eliminate the rest. Maybe someone will find it useful too.
