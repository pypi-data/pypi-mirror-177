## Typing stubs for Send2Trash

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Send2Trash` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `Send2Trash`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/Send2Trash. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `c6261372d7a43c71600de07ecfdf0692f74d6d85`.
