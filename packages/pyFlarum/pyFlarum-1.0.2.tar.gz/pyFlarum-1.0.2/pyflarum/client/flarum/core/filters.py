            - `order_by` - gets passed into `?sort=` parameter. Common values are `commentCount`, `createdAt` and their reverse/negated values (prefixed with `-`)
            - `query` - the search query, passed into `?filter[q]=`. This can be a string. Flarum search bar uses this. Gambits such as `author:username` are supported.
            - `ids` - fetches entries with specific ids, passed into `?filter[id]=`. This is a list, that is then converted into comma separated string.
            - `limit` - limit of entires to fetch. Flarum (by default) allows a max. of 50 entries to be fetched at once. Passed into `?page[limit]=`
            - `page` - fetch a specific page of entires. This is actually an offset - which is determined by multiplying `page` with `limit` (see above).
            - `include` - include specific entries. See [included data](https://cwkevo.github.io/pyflarum/docs/#included-data). You will likely never use this.
            - `additional_data` - this is a `dict` (`parameter: value`) of additional search parameters that you might want to use. This can be used to overwrite previous filters.
