# will-not-work-on-windows-try-from-wsl-instead

This is a placeholder package used for preventing installation on Windows for
packages that are known to not work on Windows.

If you have a Python package that only supports Unix-like systems, like Linux
 or MacOS, you can add this package as a dependency to prevent installation on
pure-Windows.

```ini
# setup.cfg

[options]
install_requires =
  # Special order section for helping pip:
  will-not-work-on-windows-try-from-wsl-instead; platform_system=="Windows"
  ...
```
