# ImGui Bundle
[ImGui Bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) is a bundle for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git), including various useful libraries from its ecosystem.
It enables to easily create ImGui applications in C++, as well as in Python.

The python bindings were autogenerated from the original C++ code, so that they are easier to keep up to date, and the python API closely matches the C++ api, making it possible to easily port research code from Python to C++.

__Request for feedback__ : ImGui Bundle is a brand-new python and C++ package (Oct 2022). [Feedback](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/issues/10) from users would be appreciated in order to make sure it works on different platforms.

__Warning__ : The API might evolve a bit during the month of November 2022. I'll remove this warning once it is more stable.

## Batteries included
ImGui Bundle include:
* [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git) : Immediate Gui library
* [hello imgui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui.git): multiplatform backend provider for imgui.
* [implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot): plotting library based on ImGui
* [ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit): Colorizing text editor
* [imgui-node-editor](https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor): Node editor
* [imgui-knobs](https://github.com/altschuler/imgui-knobs): Knobs for ImGui
* [ImFileDialog](https://github.com/pthom/ImFileDialog.git): File dialogs 
* [imgui_md](https://github.com/mekhontsev/imgui_md.git): Markdown for ImGui
* [imspinner](https://github.com/dalerank/imspinner): Spinners 
* [imgui_toggle](https://github.com/cmdwtf/imgui_toggle): Toggle switch widget

## Philosophy
* Closely mirrors the original API of ImGui and other libraries
* Original code documentation is consciously kept inside the python stubs. See for example the documentation for:
    * [imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui.pyi)
    * [implot](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi)
    * [hello imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi)
* Fully typed bindings, so that code completion works like a charm


## ImGui Backend

ImGui Bundle uses [Hello ImGui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui), which is configured to use GLFW + OpenGL3.
Under C++, this is configurable (see Hello ImGui docs), with some adaptations inside on the [cmake side](cmake/add_hello_imgui.cmake).

# Usage with Python

## Install

````bash
# Install from pypi
pip install imgui-bundle

# or install from clone
git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
cd imgui_bundle
pip install -v .
````

## Demo

````bash
# imgui_bundle_demo will run the demo shown below. 
# It also acts as a manual for ImGui Bundle with lots of examples and related code source.
imgui_bundle_demo 
````

The source for the demos can be found inside [bindings/imgui_bundle/demos](bindings/imgui_bundle/demos).

# Usage with C++

````
git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
````

Then, take inspiration from [demos_cpp/demo_haiku_implot_heart](demos_cpp/demo_haiku_implot_heart),
