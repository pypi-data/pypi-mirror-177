# https://iscinumpy.dev/post/cibuildwheel-2-2-0/
# cibuildwheel has added a new platform: musllinux
# Remember, the manylinux1 image has been in maintenance mode, has no support for Python 3.10,
# and will be fully retired at the end of 2021.
#
# This also means that installing things inside the images can vary even further;
# * manylinux1 (CentOS 5), manylinux2010 (CentOS 6), and manylinux2014 (CentOS 7) all use yum;
#     => yum install -y libXcursor-devel libXi-devel libXinerama-devel libXrandr-devel
# * manylinux_2_24 (Debian 8) uses apt (and is stuck on GCC 6),
#     => apt install xorg-dev
# * musllinux_1_1 MUSL based distributions of Linux (like Alpine). uses apk
