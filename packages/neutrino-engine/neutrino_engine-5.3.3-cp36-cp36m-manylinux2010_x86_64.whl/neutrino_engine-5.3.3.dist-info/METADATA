# Neutrino Engine

Neutrino is a deep learning library for optimizing and accelerating deep neural networks to make them faster, smaller and more energy-efficient. Neural network designers can specify a variety of pre-trained models, datasets and target computation constraints and ask the engine to optimize the network. High-level APIs are provided to make the optimization process easy and transparent to the user. Neutrino can be biased to concentrate on compression (relative to disk size taken by the model) or latency (forward call’s execution time) optimization.
