"""
API classes for using the role system. The role system is based on the idea, that
everything an agent can do, is described as role/responsibility and is implemented in
one separate class. For example participating in a coalition would be a separate role,
monitoring grid voltage another one.

A role is part of a :class:`RoleAgent` which inherits from :class:`Agent`.
Depending on what you need there are different role classes:
* SimpleReactiveRole: handling a specific message (e.g. pong-Role)
* ProactiveRole: for time dependent not reactive work loads (e.g. monitoring)
* Role: generic interface for all possible behavioral styles

There are essentially two APIs for acting resp reacting:
* [Reacting] :func:`RoleContext.subscribe_message`, which allows you to subscribe to
             certain message types and lets you handle the message
* [Acting] :func:`RoleContext.schedule_task`, this allows you to schedule a task with
            delay/repeating/...

To interact with the environment an instance of the role context is provided. This context
provides methods to share data with other roles and to communicate with other agents. 

A message can be send using the method :func:`RoleContext.send_message`.

There are often dependencies between different parts of an agent, there are options to
interact with other roles: Roles have the possibility to use shared models and to act on
changes of these models. A role can subscribe specific data that another role provides.
To set this up, a model has to be created via
:func:`RoleContext.get_or_create_model`. To notify other roles
:func:`RoleContext.update` has to be called. In order to let a Role subscribe to a model you can use
:func:`subscribe_model`.
If you prefer a lightweight variant you can use :func:`RoleContext.data` to assign/access shared data.

Furthermore there are two lifecycle methods to know about:
* :func:`Role.setup` is called when the Role is added to the agent, so its the perfect place
                     for initialization and scheduling of tasks
* :func:`Role.on_stop` is called when the container the agent lives in, is shut down
