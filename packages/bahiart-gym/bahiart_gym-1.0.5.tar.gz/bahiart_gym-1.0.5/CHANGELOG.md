# CHANGELOG
### Release 1.0.4
- Removing receiveOk and sendFlag on agent comms. Added returns to all functions (returns true or false if the message is sent or not, returning message when executing receive or receiveAll). Added a dictionary to store the last message received by each agent.
- Communication: First 4 bytes should contain the message length. (Full message should contain first4bytes + message)
- world now retrieves teams' names from both sides
- Initialization script to run server, agents and gym automatically. Fixing singleton class and initialization of the env (trying to solve starting latency).
