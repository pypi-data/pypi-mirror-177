Only works on PHYS cluster & tests up to 4 nodes!

Need the topology file in the directory where you execute the script. Benchmark results will be printed under filename Benchmark_Perfomance.png in the same directory where script was executed. Check progress by executing squeue -n bingo in terminal (when no jobs are running, results should be available)

NEED TO LOAD ANACONDA/3/2020.2 ON PHYS CLUSTER PRIOR TO USING LIB

Need to login to cluster with ssh-o ServerAliveInterval=300 login@mpi because when terminal disconnects from cluster, process stops (wip).

Execute the following:

module load anaconda/3/2020.02 

python3

from phys_benchmark import num_nodes

num_nodes( < # of nodes you want to test -- 4 nodes max > )

exit()
