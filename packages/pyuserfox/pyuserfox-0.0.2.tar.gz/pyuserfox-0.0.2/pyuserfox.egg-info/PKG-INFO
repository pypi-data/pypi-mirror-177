The argparse module makes it easy to write user friendly command line interfaces.

The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure out how 
to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically generates 
help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments.

As of Python >= 2.7 and >= 3.2, the argparse module is maintained within the Python 
standard library. For users who still need to support Python < 2.7 or < 3.2, it is also 
provided as a separate package, which tries to stay compatible with the module in the 
standard library, but also supports older Python versions.

Also, we can fix bugs here for users who are stuck on some non-current python version, 
like e.g. 3.2.3 (which has bugs that were fixed in a later 3.2.x release).


Bugs

If you find a bug in argparse (pypi), please try to reproduce it with latest python 2.7 and 3.4 (and use argparse from stdlib).

If it happens there also, please file a bug in the python.org issue tracker. If it does not happen there, file a bug in the argparse package issue tracker.
