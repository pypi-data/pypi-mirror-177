# [->] Nexsys
An equation solving program written in Python and Rust üêçü¶Ä

Nexsys (i**N**tuitive **E**quations, e**X**pressions, and **SYS**tems) is inspired by 
Engineering Equation Solver (EES), which is a program intended for engineers 
working with thermal or fluids-heavy systems. This tool allows engineers to 
develop massive mathematical models of the systems they work with and produce 
optimized designs in less time than it might take to develop the same model 
in Python or Matlab.

The main drawback of EES is its closed-source nature and poor ability to integrate
with non-Windows machines and other software, so with an interest in simulation
and computer-aided engineering, I took it upon myself to fill the gap.
