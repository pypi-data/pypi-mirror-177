*Nov 20, 2022*

Iâ€™m pleased to announce a new version 4.13 is available now.

Get Nitrate
===========

From PyPI
---------

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 -m pip install nitrate-tcms

No RPM Packages
---------------

Since version, no RPM package is built. Nitrate is only packaged into
container images. Please refer to next section.

Container Images
----------------

``quay.io/nitrate/nitrate`` and ``quay.io/nitrate/nitrate-worker`` are
deprecated, please migrate to new image:

* ``quay.io/nitrate/web:4.13``: the main image including Nitrate Web
  application.

* ``quay.io/nitrate/worker:4.13``: an optional worker image if the
  asynchronous tasks scheduled and run by Celery are required.

Refer to :ref:`deployment` for detailed information.

For more information about containers, please refer to `Nitrate/containers`_
