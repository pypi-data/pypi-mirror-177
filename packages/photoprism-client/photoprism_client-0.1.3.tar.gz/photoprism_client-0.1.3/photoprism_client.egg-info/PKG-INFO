Description: # Python client for PhotoPrism 
        A Python client to interact with photoprism.
        
        ## IMPORTANT
        This Python client is build on the undocumented API of PhotoPrism. There may be bugs in there. Please let me know if you find some. 
        
        Currently tested on the [version of the 17th of June 2022](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/releases/tag/220617-0402b8d3). It will probably work with later versions. Just try it and let me know, I will update the readme accordingly.  
        
        ## Requirements
        - requests (latest)
        
        ## Setup
        To start interacting with Photoprism set up a session. You always need to do this if you start the script. Otherwise there is no session for the client to interact with PhotoPrism.
        ``` python
        from photoprism.Session import Session
        pp_session = Session("admin", "changethis", "demo.photoprism.app")
        pp_session.create()
        ```
        
        ## Searching
        To search for photos. With this example it will return the first 100 results. You can change this with `count=1000`.
        
        ```python
        from photoprism.Photo import Photo
        
        p = Photo(pp_session)
        p.search(query="original:*")
        ```
