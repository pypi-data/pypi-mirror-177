<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Ok, maybe you could't understand the purpose of that application. Let's see if I can explain it.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't drink the needed amount of water, but you may know that it can led us to a lot of health problems. This is where this application wants to help you, with it you can make sure that you are drinking the right amount every day.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The "daily goal" (amount of water that you need to drink) was got and verified in some sites (and some Play Store apps), but it can be incorrect (in warm days you need to drink more, for example). The volume is in ml. Never ignore any medical advice.</p>
