        <div>
            Text can be nested in <span>html tags</span>. Multiple whitespaces
            are collapsed, but we try to keep linebreaks (\n). Sentences can
            span multiple

            <div></div>

            lines.
        </div>

        <div>
            We should be able to split sentences that contain: 1. multiple dots
            and interpunctation 2. lists and other things ... but still be just
            one sentence.

                    However, this sentencing does not have to be perfect, e.g.
                    deteciting some artifacts as sentences should still be ok.
                    With the TextRank algorithm and other plausibility checks
                    (e.g. POS checking with spaCy) we should be able to filter
                    these.

            Here's a list of things, let's see how this split:
            <ul>
                <li>Point 1</li>
                <li>Point 2</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
