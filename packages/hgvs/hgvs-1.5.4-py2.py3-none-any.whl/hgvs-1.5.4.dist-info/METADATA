           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

*hgvs* - manipulate biological sequence variants according to Human Genome Variation Society recommendations
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Important:** biocommons packages require Python 3.6+.
`More
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hgvs-discuss/iLUzjzoD-28>`__


The *hgvs* package provides a Python library to parse, format,
validate, normalize, and map sequence variants according to `Variation
Nomenclature`_ (aka Human Genome Variation Society) recommendations.

Specifically, the hgvs package focuses on the subset of the HGVS
recommendations that precisely describe sequence-level variation
relevant to the application of high-throughput sequencing to clinical
diagnostics.  The package does not attempt to cover the full scope of
HGVS recommendations. Please refer to `issues
<https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues>`_ for limitations.

Features
@@@@@@@@

* Parsing is based on formal grammar.
* An easy-to-use object model that represents
  most variant types (SNVs, indels, dups, inverstions, etc) and
  concepts (intronic offsets, uncertain positions, intervals)
* A variant normalizer that rewrites variants in canoncial forms and
  substitutes reference sequences (if reference and transcript
  sequences differ)
* Formatters that generate HGVS strings from internal representations
* Tools to map variants between genome, transcript, and protein sequences
* Reliable handling of regions genome-transcript discrepancies
* Pluggable data providers support alternative sources of transcript mapping
  data
* Extensive automated tests, including those for all variant types and
  "problematic" transcripts
* Easily installed using remote data sources.  Installation with local
  data sources is straightforward and completely obviates network
  access


Important Notes
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

* **You are encouraged to** `browse issues
  <https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues>`_.  All known issues are
  listed there.  Please report any issues you find.
* **Use a pip package specification to stay within minor releases.**
  For example, ``hgvs>=1.5,<1.6``. `hgvs` uses `Semantic Versioning
  <http://semver.org/>`__.


Examples
@@@@@@@@

Installation
#############

By default, `hgvs` uses remote data sources, which makes installation
easy.  

::

  $ mkvirtualenv hgvs-test
  (hgvs-test)$ pip install --upgrade setuptools
  (hgvs-test)$ pip install hgvs
  (hgvs-test)$ python

See `Installation instructions
<http://hgvs.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installation.html>`__ for
details, including instructions for installing `Universal Transcript
Archive (UTA) <https://github.com/biocommons/uta/>`__ and `SeqRepo
<https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/>`__ locally.


Configuration
#############

`hgvs` will use publicly available data sources unless directed
otherwise through environment variables, like so::

  # N.B. These are examples. The correct values will depend on your installation
  $ export UTA_DB_URL=postgresql://anonymous:anonymous@localhost:5432/uta/uta_20210129
  $ export HGVS_SEQREPO_DIR=/usr/local/share/seqrepo/latest

Alternatively, if you are unable to pass the postgresql password in the
UTA_DB_URL environment variable (i.e., generating an auth token), you can set
UTA_DB_URL to ``postgresql://<user>@<host>/<db>/<schema>`` and set PGPASSWORD. For example::

  $ export UTA_DB_URL=postgresql://anonymous@localhost:5432/uta/uta_20210129 PGPASSWORD=anonymous

See the installation instructions for details.


Parsing and Formating
#####################

`hgvs` parses HGVS variants (as strings) into an object model, and can format
object models back into HGVS strings.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import hgvs.parser

  # start with these variants as strings
  >>> hgvs_g = 'NC_000007.13:g.36561662C>T'
  >>> hgvs_c = 'NM_001637.3:c.1582G>A'

  # parse the genomic variant into a Python structure
  >>> hp = hgvs.parser.Parser()
  >>> var_g = hp.parse_hgvs_variant(hgvs_g)
  >>> var_g
  SequenceVariant(ac=NC_000007.13, type=g, posedit=36561662C>T, gene=None)

  # SequenceVariants are composed of structured objects, e.g.,
  >>> var_g.posedit.pos.start
  SimplePosition(base=36561662, uncertain=False)

  # format by stringification 
  >>> str(var_g)
  'NC_000007.13:g.36561662C>T'


Projecting ("Mapping") variants between aligned genome and transcript sequences
###############################################################################

`hgvs` provides tools to project variants between genome, transcript,
and protein sequences.  Non-coding and intronic variants are
supported.  Alignment data come from the `Universal Transcript Archive
(UTA) <https://github.com/biocommons/uta/>`__.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import hgvs.dataproviders.uta
  >>> import hgvs.assemblymapper

  # initialize the mapper for GRCh37 with splign-based alignments
  >>> hdp = hgvs.dataproviders.uta.connect()
  >>> am = hgvs.assemblymapper.AssemblyMapper(hdp,
  ...          assembly_name='GRCh37', alt_aln_method='splign',
  ...          replace_reference=True)
  
  # identify transcripts that overlap this genomic variant
  >>> transcripts = am.relevant_transcripts(var_g)
  >>> sorted(transcripts)
  ['NM_001177506.1', 'NM_001177507.1', 'NM_001637.3']

  # map genomic variant to one of these transcripts
  >>> var_c = am.g_to_c(var_g, 'NM_001637.3')
  >>> var_c
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001637.3, type=c, posedit=1582G>A, gene=None)
  >>> str(var_c)
  'NM_001637.3:c.1582G>A'

  # CDS coordinates use BaseOffsetPosition to support intronic offsets
  >>> var_c.posedit.pos.start
  BaseOffsetPosition(base=1582, offset=0, datum=Datum.CDS_START, uncertain=False)


Translating coding variants to protein sequences
################################################

Coding variants may be translated to their protein consequences.  HGVS
uses the same pairing of transcript and protein accessions as seen in
NCBI and Ensembl.

.. code-block:: python

   # translate var_c to its protein consequence
   # The object structure of protein variants is nearly identical to
   # that of nucleic acid variants and is converted to a string form
   # by stringification. Per HGVS recommendations, inferred consequences
   # must have parentheses to indicate uncertainty.
   >>> var_p = am.c_to_p(var_c)
   >>> var_p
   SequenceVariant(ac=NP_001628.1, type=p, posedit=(Gly528Arg), gene=None)
   >>> str(var_p)
   'NP_001628.1:p.(Gly528Arg)'

   # setting uncertain to False removes the parentheses on the
   # stringified form
   >>> var_p.posedit.uncertain = False
   >>> str(var_p)
   'NP_001628.1:p.Gly528Arg'

   # formatting can be customized, e.g., use 1 letter amino acids to
   # format a specific variant
   # (configuration may also be set globally)
   >>> var_p.format(conf={"p_3_letter": False})
   'NP_001628.1:p.G528R'



Normalizing variants
####################

Some variants have multiple representations due to instrinsic
biological ambiguity (e.g., inserting a G in a poly-G run) or due to
misunderstanding HGVS recommendations.  Normalization rewrites certain
veriants into a single representation.

.. code-block:: python

  # rewrite ins as dup (depends on sequence context)
  >>> import hgvs.normalizer
  >>> hn = hgvs.normalizer.Normalizer(hdp)
  >>> hn.normalize(hp.parse_hgvs_variant('NM_001166478.1:c.35_36insT'))
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=35dup, gene=None)

  # during mapping, variants are normalized (by default)
  >>> c1 = hp.parse_hgvs_variant('NM_001166478.1:c.31del')
  >>> c1
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=31del, gene=None)
  >>> c1n = hn.normalize(c1)
  >>> c1n
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=35del, gene=None)
  >>> g = am.c_to_g(c1)
  >>> g
  SequenceVariant(ac=NC_000006.11, type=g, posedit=49917127del, gene=None)
  >>> c2 = am.g_to_c(g, c1.ac)
  >>> c2
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=35del, gene=None)
