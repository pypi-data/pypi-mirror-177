##############################################################################

This small Python package defines a small set of functions that can be used
to test the mapping of URLs in a Django application:

* whether a URL is mapped correctly to a view
* whether a URL is not mapped to a view
* whether arguments are captured as expected


==============================================================================
Installation
==============================================================================

This package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install this package using `pip`:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python -m pip install django-test-urls


==============================================================================
Usage
==============================================================================

The fictional app that is being tested in this example contains a view that
lists every article that has been released in a given month. The following
URL pattern is used to map URLs to the aforementioned view, and captures two
values, `year` and `month`, to pass along.

.. code-block:: python

    # urls.py
    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('articles/<int:year>/<int:month>/', views.month_archive),
        ...
    ]


The following test verifies that an example URL is mapped correctly to the
right view and that values are captured correctly.

.. code-block:: python

    # test_urls.py
    from django_test_urls import resolves_to_view
    from django_test_urls import resolves_to_args
    from my_app import views


    def test_monthly_archive():
        assert resolves_to_view("articles/2022/11/", views.month_archive)
        assert resolves_to_args("articles/2022/11", {"year": 2022, "month": 11})
