    </FONT><BR>
           <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
           <p> A two-module system is created for automated web activity monitoring. A
         model is generated and model outliers are identified by the first module
         of the system. Reports are generated that identify the events based on
         their significance to the outliers. The model may be automatically and
         periodically regenerated for different historical time periods of the web
         sessions. New groups of events may be periodically extracted from new web
         sessions and applied to the previously generated model by the second
         module of the system. Model outliers may be identified from the new
         groups of events. The new events may be analyzed and reported to a web
         session operator based on their contribution to any identified outliers.
         Even if no outliers are detected, the new events having a most
         significant impact on web session operating conditions may be identified
         and reported in real-time.

    <CENTER><b><i>Claims</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>The invention claimed is: <BR><BR> 1.  A method, comprising: identify, by a processing device, events for web sessions, wherein the events comprise network data including webpages, requests, and/or
    responses sent over a network between a web server and user devices during the web sessions;  and user inputs entered at user devices for interacting with the webpages;  generating, by the processing device, a model from the events;  identifying, by the
    processing device, outliers against the model;  and generating, by the processing device, reports identifying the events based on a significance of the events to the outliers.
    <BR><BR> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: replaying the web sessions by synchronizing rendering of at least some of the network data associated with the outliers with replay of at least some of the user inputs associated with the outliers
    in substantially a same order as previously occurring during the web sessions.
    <BR><BR> 3.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: automatically extracting, by the processing device, new events for new web sessions;  generating, by the processing device, transformed data by performing a modeling transformation with the new
    events;  calculating, by the processing device, a distance of the transformed data to the model;  determining, by the processing device, whether the transformed data represent an outlier;  and generating, by the processing device, at least one of the
    reports identifying outlier status of the new events and a list of top contributing new events to the distance of the transformed data to the model.
    <BR><BR> 4.  The method of claim 3, wherein the top contributing new events comprise error messages generated by a web application during the web sessions.

    <CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>BACKGROUND
    <BR><BR> Data-driven e-business environments have to deal with overwhelmingly large amounts of data.  These large amounts of data can make it difficult to monitor the general health of an e-business system and answer everyday business questions such as
    whether a portal is functioning normally or why business today is different from business yesterday or why it is different from business the same day last week.
    <BR><BR> Data sources may be spread across a company.  For example, computer usage information may be used by an Information Technology (IT) division of the company and sales information may be used by sales and marketing divisions of the company.  Some
    data sources may give identical results, whereas other data sources may become outdated and have no impact on the business.  All of these diverse types of information may create a garbage effect that obscures important business events in the enterprise
    system.
    <BR><BR> A selective individual (univariate) statistical approach may heuristically pick important sources of information for monitoring in the enterprise system but may not identify other important events that may be the cause of a system abnormality.
    Monitoring individual data items also may produce false alarms that can diminish the credibility of the reporting system. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

    <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    <BR><BR> FIG. 1 depicts an example of an analysis system 130 that automatically generates models for normal network session activity and uses the models to identify outliers and detect significant web session events.  The analysis system 130 accesses
    stored web session events data 118 from a database referred to as a session archive 132.  Web session events data 118 may contain important information about user experiences during the web sessions 100.  However, as explained above, revealing this
    information may not be straightforward.  For example, a drop in online sales may be associated with a group of web session events happening coherently at certain periods.  In this case it is practically impossible to detect and explain this anomaly by
    cherry-picking and monitoring individual events data.  Moreover, other web session events 118 incorrectly selected from session archive 132 may produce other error messages preventing an operator from correlating the significance of particular user
    interface events data with the drop in sales.
    <BR><BR> Analysis system 130 deals with these problems by analyzing the whole set of available web session events and by automatically selecting only those events that are informationally important for the model.  This way, analysis system 130 actually
    turns the problems associated with too many web session events into an asset by using the large number of different web session events to generate a more holistic model of the e-commerce system while at the same time isolating the most likely causes of
    abnormal e-commerce system behavior.
    <BR><BR> Analysis system 130 generates a network session model 136 that models normal operating web sessions.  Model 136 may identify outliers in the model space that indicate unusual web session operations and identify the list of web session events 142
    that have the highest contributions to the outliers.
    <BR><BR> The web session modeling can also minimize the number of false alarms.  For example, certain events may appear to be outliers when analyzed individually.  However, the multivariate web session model can determine that such web session conditions
    are associated with normal web site operations or can determine that certain web session events have little significance to an abnormal web session condition.  Analysis system 130 can also identify duplicate web session events that may operate in a same
    manner in the web session model but may be given different event names.  For example, events producing the same results can be inadvertently created by different departments of the company.  One of the duplicated events can then be removed from further
    capture operations.
    <BR><BR> Web Session Events
    <BR><BR> Web sessions 100 may be conducted between a web application 104 operating on a web server 102 and different user devices 110.  Web application 104 may be configured for any type of online session such as online purchases or online financial
    services.  Of course, these are just examples, and any type of electronic web based transaction or online activity may be performed using web application 104.
    <BR><BR> User device 110 may comprise a Personal Computer (PC), laptop computer, wireless Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, or any other wired or wireless device that accesses and exchanges information with web application 104.  It
    should be understood that multiple user devices 110 may conduct different web sessions 100 with web application 104.  However, for explanation purposes, only one user device 110 is shown in FIG. 1.
    <BR><BR> User device 110 may communicate with web application 104 over a network connection 108.  Network connection 108 may comprise any combination of connections over an Internet network, a wireless network, a telephone network, Public Services
    Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular network, a Wi-Fi network, a cable network, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), or the like, or any combination thereof.
    <BR><BR> In one example, user device 110 may send a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to web application 104 over network connection 108.  Web application 104 may send back one or more of webpages 106 in response to the HTTP request and user
    device 110 may display the webpages 106 via a web browser 112 on a screen of user device 110.  A user may generate user interface (UI) events during the web session 100.  For example, the user may select links on displayed webpages 106 or enter
    keystrokes that insert data into fields within the displayed webpages 106.  Web application 104 may send additional webpages 106 and/or responses to user device 110 in response to the user interface events.
    <BR><BR> Different web session monitors 116 and/or 120 may capture web session events 118 during web sessions 100.  Web session events 118 may comprise the user interface events generated on user device 110 and any network data transferred over network
    connection 108 between user device 100 and web application 104.  For example, the web session events 118 may comprise the HTTP requests and other data requests sent from user device 110 to web application 104 and the webpages and other responses sent
    back to user device 110 from web application 104.
    <BR><BR> Some of the web session events 118 may never be transferred over network connection 108.  For example, some of the user interface events, such as mouse clicks, keystrokes, alpha-numeric data entered into webpage fields, selection of webpage
    icons, or the like, or any combination thereof, may change a current state of webpage 106 without sending any data over network connection 108.  In another example, a batch data transfer of only completed information from webpage 106 may be transferred
    to web application 104 over network connection 108.
    <BR><BR> Some of the web session events 118 may comprise data sent from web application 104 in response user interface events.  For example, web session events 118 may include airline scheduling data used for populating a drop down menu in a previously
    downloaded webpage 106.  The airline scheduling data may have been sent by web application 104 in response to a user entering a city destination into an airline destination field of displayed webpage 106.
    <BR><BR> Other web session events 118 may comprise webpage logic/code sent by web application 104 along with the webpages 106 to user device 110 that further determine the different states or operations in the webpage.  The webpage logic may autonomously
    change the state of webpages 106 or the state of web session 100 on user device 110 without ever sending a request or information back over network connection 108 to web application 104.
    <BR><BR> In another example, some web session events 118 may comprise Document Object Model (DOM) changes within webpages 106.  For example, changes in the DOM of displayed webpage 106 may be captured by UI event monitor 116 as some of web session events
    118.  In yet another example, web session events 118 may comprise operating parameters and any other logged data in user device 110 and/or server 102.  For example, web session events 118 may comprise network bandwidth indicators, processor bandwidth
    indicators, network condition indicators, computer operating conditions, or the like, or any combination thereof.
    <BR><BR> In one example, network session monitor 120 may capture the network data, such as the webpages 106, requests, responses, and/or logic exchanged between user device 110 and web application 104 over network connection 108.  User Interface (UI)
    monitor 116 may capture the user interface events generated locally at user device 110.  In another example, UI monitor 116 also may capture some or all of the network data exchanged between user device 110 and web application 104 over network connection
    108.
    <BR><BR> In yet another example, UI event monitor 116 and/or network session monitor 120 may not capture some or all the actual web session events 118 but may only detect occurrences of some web session events 118.  In this example, monitors 116 and 120
    may send unique identifiers identifying occurrences of web session events 118 and may send timestamps indicating when the web session events were detected.
    <BR><BR> Examples of systems for capturing and/or identifying web session events are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,286,030 issued Sep. 4, 2001, entitled: Systems and Methods for Recording and Visually Recreating Sessions in a Client-Server Environment,
    now reissued as U.S.  Pat.  No. RE41903; U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,127,000 issued Feb.  28, 2012, entitled: Method and Apparatus for Monitoring and Synchronizing User Interface Events with Network Data; and U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 13/419,179 filed
    Mar.  13, 2012, entitled: Method and Apparatus for Intelligent Capture of Document Object Model Events which are all herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.
    <BR><BR> Web Session Modeling and Monitoring
    <BR><BR> Web session modeling and monitoring consists of two separate modules: modeling and monitoring.  The modeling module works with historical data and creates the model of normal activity.  The monitoring module uses the model saved by the modeling
    module and works with the current web session data, such as web session events captured during the last hour.
    <BR><BR> During a model generation phase, analysis system 130 may operate a model generator 134 for generating network session model 136 from web session events 133 associated with a historical model generation time period for web sessions 100.  For
    example, such historical period may comprise the last one to three months data on web sessions 100.  Network session model 136 may model a normal operating condition for web sessions 100 and the computer system operating web sessions 100.
    <BR><BR> Analysis system 130 may generate reports 140 listing the outliers of the normal operating conditions and identifying web session events 142 associated with the outliers.  Network session model 136 also may identify which web session events 142
    have the highest impact in the associated outliers.
    <BR><BR> Model generator 134 may select which captured web session events 133 in session archive 132 to use for generating network session model 136.  For example, some web session events 118 may be associated with temporary operating conditions, such as
    a yearly sales promotion.  The sales promotion events may not be associated with normal online operating conditions and may be removed from generating model 136 and from reports 140.
    <BR><BR> During a second monitoring phase, analysis system 130 may use web session model 136 to monitor new web session events 138 from web sessions 100.  For example, new web session events 138 may comprise web session events periodically captured and
    aggregated over a last several minutes, hour, day, week, etc. The number of occurrences for each type of web session event 138 may be aggregated over the monitoring time period.  For example, there may be 157 online purchases detected during a last one
    hour monitoring time period.
    <BR><BR> Web session events 138 for the monitoring time period are applied to network session model 136 and may operate within the found normal operating model boundaries or as an outlier operating outside the model boundaries.  Statistical significance
    of an outlier being outside the model boundaries may be set to the values that suggest some real business reasons for abnormal behavior.  Detected outlier reports 140 are sent to a pre-defined list of addressees.  The most influential web session events
    142 either for the outlier or for the normal operating time period may be identified in reports 140.
    <BR><BR> The time periods, thresholds, and other parameters used for generating model 136 and for identifying outliers within model 136 may be preconfigured in a configuration file 135.  Configuration file 135 also may identify black-listed web session
    events that are removed prior to generating model 136 or removed from reports 140.
    <BR><BR> The first modeling module (model creation) can either be executed manually or scheduled to be executed automatically.  In the latter case the periodicity of model re-creation depends on the length of the historical period used for the model
    generation.  For example, if one month of data is used to create a model, then the model may be re-created at least every 3 weeks or every month.  For the second module, web session monitoring is typically scheduled to run automatically and the
    periodicity of monitoring depends on aggregation granularity.  For example, the monitor should be scheduled to run hourly if web session events are aggregated on an hourly basis.  In the fully automated mode, after the initial setup, the system may run
    and provide valuable business insights without any additional human interaction.
    <BR><BR> Analysis system 130 may be configured to catch and use newly created web session events on the fly.  After initial setup, analysis system 130 may operate automatically, or an operator may choose to manually create web session model 136 by
    selecting specific web session events 118.  However, the operator is not required to pre-select any web session events 118, facts, or any other specific information regarding web sessions 100.  The operator also does not need to manually correlate or
    analyze any data distribution results.  Thus, the operator does not need to manually pre-select between thousands of possible web session events for analysis.
    <BR><BR> Analysis system 130 provides a powerful and easy-to-use and to easy-to-interpret system for automatically monitoring the health of e-commerce systems.  Multivariate modeling may be used to increase scalability over univariate approaches, since
    using a wider variety of web session events 118 can model more business aspects of the e-commerce system and create a better holistic representation of user experiences during web sessions 100.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 2 depicts an example process for generating a web session model for the first module of the system, the model creation.  In operation 148, the analysis system may recreate a new model each historical modeling period.  For example, a new
    model may be recreated each month.  In operation 150, a configuration file may be checked to identify any model parameters used for generating the model.  For example, parameters in the configuration file 135 in FIG. 1 may designate threshold levels used
    for identifying web session outliers, details on the ODBC connection to the web session database, email server configuration for alert notification and so on.
    <BR><BR> In operation 152, web session events may be extracted from the session archive database for the historical model period.  For example, the web session events may have associated timestamps and the analysis system may extract the web session
    events from the session archive for the last month of timestamps.  In operation 154, the extracted web session events are processed.  For example, not all web session events may occur every hour.  Missing events are usually not present in the extracted
    data for a given timestamp.  The operation 154 includes processing the missed events and other data cleaning procedures.  In operation 156, the model generator may calculate the web session model from the processed web session events.  For example, the
    model generator may generate a multivariate mathematical model from occurrences of the web session events.
    <BR><BR> In operation 158, outliers are detected for the web session model.  For example, the data point associated with a certain timestamp period may be projected by the modeling transformation outside of a normal operating threshold of the model.  The
    outlying timestamp periods are identified in operation 158.  Reports may be generated in operation 160 that identify the most significant web session events for the detected outliers.  Such reports contain the outlier timestamps and the list of the
    highest contributing events for each outlier timestamp.
    <BR><BR> In operation 162, the created multivariate model together with all transformation parameters used to create the model and thresholds used to detect the outliers, are saved onto the hard drive for subsequent usage by the second module of the
    system, the real-time monitoring module.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 3 depicts example operations for processing the web session events prior to generating the web session model.  In operation 170, the web session events are extracted from the session archive database for the modeling time period.  The
    session archive may be open to any source of data, including flat files.  In one example, a Microsoft.RTM.  SQL database may be used, and an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) may be used for connection to the database.
    <BR><BR> In operation 172, the number of occurrences for each web session event may be accumulated for sub-portions of the configurable historical time period.  For example, the number of occurrences for each web session event may be aggregated for each
    hour over a last month of captured historical data.  The aggregated web session events may be assigned associated timestamps and listed in a table.  The number of occurrences for the web session events may be counted by the monitoring system prior to the
    aggregated web session events being processed by the analysis system.
    <BR><BR> In operation 174, the count values for the web session events may be reshaped into a wide table so that every row represents a certain timestamp and every column represents a certain event.  Web session events are represented in the columns of
    the wide table with a unique code (UNIQUEID-coded event variable).
    <BR><BR> In operation 176, the web session events may be filtered.  For example, there may be no occurrences of certain web session events for certain one hour periods.  A non-occurrence is alternatively referred to as a Not Applicable (NA).  Web session
    events that only rarely happen might be filtered from the wide table in operation 176.  For example, any web session events that have more than X % of NA values may be removed from the wide table.  The X % value may be a selectable value specified in the
    configuration file 135 in FIG. 1 and in one example may have a default value of X=50%.  The rationale for this is that a model is created of normal behavior, not exceptional behavior.  Events that are rare but important can be monitored by the operator
    on an individual basis.  All remaining NA values after these operations are replaced with zeroes, representing zero occurrences of corresponding events.
    <BR><BR> In operation 178, some web session events may be removed from web session model generation, monitoring and/or alerting.  For example one of the web session events may be caused by an attempt to redeem cash bonus with not enough credits.  This
    event might be fired at abnormal count levels as a result of an ad-hoc marketing campaign.  A large number of these events may cause the web session model to produce unnecessary alarms.  To avoid annoying alarms the user can temporarily add the event to
    the blacklist.
    <BR><BR> If created during a historical period that overlaps with the marketing campaign, the web session model may be too lousy and allow too many outliers to pass unnoticed.  In either case, the operator may black-list the web session event to prevent
    the model from identifying outliers that are usually associated with normal web session operations.  The remaining web session events may be used in operation 180 to generate the web session model.
    <BR><BR> In operation 182, duplicate web session events may be identified.  For example, some web session events may have different unique identifiers but may represent the same web session event.  For example, two different divisions in an enterprise
    may have created two different events for capturing the same web session data.  The identified web session events may be identified during creation of the web session model and displayed to the operator in operation 182.  The operator may reconfigure the
    monitoring system so that one of the duplicate events is no longer captured and stored in the session archive.  This may reduce the amount of processing for capturing, storing, and analyzing duplicate web session events.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 4A depicts an example of a first table 190 identifying occurrences of web session events for a particular one hour time period as it looks after extraction from the database.  In this example, column 192 identifies hour-long time periods.
    Column 194 lists the unique identifiers associated with each of the different web session events.  Column 196 lists the number of occurrences for each of the different web session events for the hour-long time period identified in column 190.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 4B depicts an example of a second wide table 200 listing all the web session events for the entire historical modeling period after the data reshaping process 174.  For example, row 202 may list the number of occurrences for each of the
    different web session events for a first one hour time period starting at 7:00 pm on Oct.  29, 2011 as previously shown in table 190 of FIG. 4A.  Column 204 lists all of the individual one hour time periods during the historical modeling period that in
    one example may be one month.  Column 206 lists the number of occurrences for each of the web session events for each of the one hour time periods listed in column 204.
    <BR><BR> For example, the web session event assigned unique identifier V.1 had 284,262 occurrences during the one hour time period starting at 2:00 am on Oct.  30, 2011.  In another example, the web session event assigned unique identifier V.22 had zero
    occurrences during the one hour time periods starting at 11:00 pm on Oct.  29, 2011; 3:00 am on Oct.  30, 2011; and 5:00 am on Oct.  30, 2011.  Web session event V.22 has few NA's during the period displayed on FIG. 4B, but still passed through the
    sparsity filter and is included in data modeling and monitoring process.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 5 depicts an example of a process for generating the web session model.  In operation 220, the number of occurrences of the web session events may be normalized.  As explained above, the web session model may represent a normal web session
    behavior.  For different web session events a normal range or occurrences may be different.  For example, a normal average number of occurrences for a first web session event per hour may be 10,000 and a normal average number of occurrences for a second
    web session event per hour may be 5.  Thus, the event counts may be normalized in operation 220 to be centered at mean and ranged to fall between 0 and 1.
    <BR><BR> In operation 222, a covariance matrix may be calculated for the normalized occurrences of the web session events and in operation 224 eigenvectors may be calculated from the covariance matrix.  The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix provide
    the principle components for the web session model.
    <BR><BR> In operation 226, a cross-validation is performed on the data.  Cross-validation may consist of repeated exclusion of data for some of the timestamp periods (timestamp data) and calculation of a total variance ratio retained after application of
    the principal components to the remaining dataset.  This procedure allows estimating a level of noise penetrated into the web session model which is opposite to the predictive power of the model.  The cross-validation results may also be used to
    determine the optimal number of principal components for the model.
    <BR><BR> A number of principle components for the model are selected in operation 228.  The number of principal components can be selected based on different criteria.  For example, the number of principal components may be based on a retained variance
    ratio reaching a pre-defined amount, such as a default value of 85%.  Alternatively, the number of principle components can be determined to maximize the predictive power of the model as revealed by the cross-validation process 226.  Normalizing data,
    calculating a covariance matrix and eigenvectors, cross-validating data, and selecting principle components from the data are operations known to those skilled in data processing.
    <BR><BR> Some operations described below for generating a model may be manually performed using existing software systems and may be described in more detail in L. Eriksson, E. Johansson, N. Kettaneh-Wold, J. Trygg, C. Wikstroem, S. Wold "Multi- and
    Megavariate Data Analysis" 2006, Umetrics (Eriksson) which is herein incorporated by reference.  To create a fully automated modeling component for the system, original software was developed to implement the described algorithms.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 6A depicts an example histogram for a pertained variance ratio 240 of the timestamp data.  Pertained variance ratio 240 grows steadily with each new principal component added to the web session model.  Each principal component is a weighted
    linear combination of the web session events.
    <BR><BR> A second histogram represents a cross-validation 242 and indicates a predictive power of the web session model.  Noise in the data may reduce the relative pertained variance ratio.  In one example, principal components may be calculated until
    the cross-validation ratio 242 reaches a pre-defined threshold portion of the pertained variance ratio.  For example, principal components may be added until cross-validation ratio 242 reaches a default of 85% of the pertained variance ratio 240.  This
    may indicate a threshold value where additional principal components may only add noise into the web session model and effectively decrease the predictive power of the model.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 6B depicts is a projection of the observations data onto the two-dimensional plane defined by the first two principal components from the web session model.  Elements 244 represent timestamped web session event observations and an ellipse
    243 represents the statistical confidence ellipsoid as projected onto the same plane.  A default confidence level may be 95%, meaning that all the observation points outside the ellipsoid represent statistically abnormal activity with 95% confidence
    level.  Any elements 244 located outside of ellipse 243 may therefore be investigated further as possible outliers.
    <BR><BR> In practice, outlier detection is performed not on the projection plane like shown on FIG. 6B, but in the whole principal components space.  Two formulas may be used for generating thresholds in multivariate principal component space for the
    outlier detection.
    <BR><BR> A first model is based on the notion of Hotelling T.sup.2 distance in the model space.  Let us denote the total number of model principal components as A and the total number of the time-stamped web events observations in the wide table as N.
    The Hotelling T.sup.2 distance for the i-th observation is defined as:
    <BR><BR> .times..times.  ##EQU00001## where t.sub.a is the model scores vector and s.sub.ia.sup.2 is the variance of t.sub.a.  It is described in Eriksson et al. that T.sub.i.sup.2N(N-A)/A(N.sup.2-1) satisfies F-distribution with A and (N-A) degrees of
    freedom.  Therefore, the threshold for the outlier detection with 95% confidence level may be calculated as: T.sub.threshold=A(N.sup.2-1)/N(N-A)F.sub.critical(p=0.05)
    <BR><BR> The second criterion is based on the notion of distance to model.  If K denotes the total number of web events included into the model, then normalized distance to the model for the i-th observation is defined as:
    <BR><BR> ##EQU00002## .times..times.  ##EQU00002.2## .times.  ##EQU00002.3## where E={e.sub.ij} is the residual matrix for the model.  The threshold value for DmodX may be determined based on the fact that s.sub.i.sup.2/s.sub.0.sup.2 satisfies
    F-distribution with the degrees of freedom of observations and the model.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 7A depicts a visual representation of the Hotelling T.sup.2 model identifying distances of elements 246 inside of a model space with the optimum number of principal components identified in FIG. 6A.  Ellipsoid 250 represents the model
    boundary as defined by the threshold of the Hotelling T.sup.2 distance.  FIG. 7B depicts a visual representation of the DmodX model that identifies distances of elements 246 to the model space.  The plane DC2 in FIG. 7B represents an A-dimensional
    principal components sub-space in K-dimensional space of observations.  Each plane DC1 and DC3 represents the DmodX thresholds around the model space that is used to detect the outliers by the distance-to-model method.
    <BR><BR> Elements 246 in the two model spaces of FIGS. 7A and 7B represent timestamp data observations and the timestamp data observations represent the set of web session events for the given timestamp period, such as a one hour time period.
    Observation 248 may be identified as an outlier when an associated distance extends beyond threshold 250 for the Hotelling T.sup.2 in FIG. 7A or beyond a threshold associated with the DmodX model in FIG. 7B.  The thresholds multipliers may be specified
    by the user in the configuration file 135 in FIG. 1.  The threshold multipliers may be used to control the volume of outlier notifications, if needed.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 8A depicts an example of a chart 260 having a y-axis identifying the different timestamps and a x-axis identifying the Hotelling T.sup.2 distances of the timestamps for the model shown in FIG. 7A.  A second chart (not shown) may identify
    the timestamps and the distances of the timestamps to the model space for the DmodX model shown in FIG. 7B in the same manner.  A threshold 264 in chart 260 represents the boundary for the Hotelling T.sup.2 model.  A timestamp outlier 266 may be any
    point above the statistical threshold 264 defined for the Hotelling T.sup.2 model.  Several consecutive outlying timestamps 262 may be considered as one outlier with a duration of several hours.  In the case of a prolonged outlier, the timestamp with the
    maximum distance may be used for the most significant contributors analysis described below.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 8B depicts an example of a contribution chart 270 showing the relative contribution of the different web session events to the timestamp outlier 266 shown in FIG. 8A.  The x-axis in chart 270 represents the different web session events and
    the y-axis represents the normalized contributions of the different web session events to timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A.  For example, chart 270 may identify the weighted contribution of each of the web session events to the one hour timestamp outlier
    266.  As shown in FIG. 8B, a web session event V60 has a largest contribution and a web session event V1242 has a second large contribution.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 8C depicts a chart 280 also showing the contribution of the web session events to timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A.  In this example, the y-axis identifies the web session events and the x-axis identifies the different web session events in
    decreasing order of contribution to outlier 266.  The most significant contributors to the outlier that exceed the pre-defined number of standard deviations above the mean for the chart 280 are referred to as top contributors.  If there are no such
    events, the maximum contributor may be considered a single top mover.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 8D depicts an example of a table 290 showing the top contributing web session events 292 for timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A.  The web session events 292 may be listed in table 290 in order of contribution amount to the Hotelling T.sup.2
    distance of outlier 266 and may represent web session events that have the most influence in causing the web sessions to operate outside of normal operating conditions.  Web session event V.60 was identified as having the most significant contribution to
    outlier 266 in FIG. 8A and web session event V.1242 was identified as having the second most significant contribution to outlier 266.
    <BR><BR> For example, the most significant web session event V.60 may be associated with an error message indicating a rental car fare was not found, the second most significant web session event V.1242 may be associated with an error message requesting
    a user to select a pick-up time, a third most signification event may be associated with an error message requesting a user to select a drop-off time; and a fourth most signification event may indicate a user has been connected to the web application
    beyond some define time period.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 8E depicts an example of a chart 294 plotting one of the most significant web session events V.186 contributing to the timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A.  Classic univariate Shewart control charts may be calculated for the most significant
    web session events.  Univariate control charts may be calculated for already found outliers and only for demonstration purposes.  This is one primary difference between multivariate modeling and traditional univariate control: outliers are found by
    multivariate modeling and charts may only be performed on the reporting stage.  The time and number of occurrences 296 of web session event V.186 associated with timestamp outlier 266 may be marked with a red box.  Additional charts can be plotted for
    the other significant contributors 292 and the timestamps and number of occurrences associated with the timestamp outlier 266 may be marked similarly to event V186.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 9 summarizes operations for identifying the most significant contributors for timestamp outliers.  In operation 300, outliers are identified by the multivariate web session modeling.  In operation 302, contributions of the web session
    events to the timestamp outliers are calculated.  In operation 304, the most significant web session event contributors are identified as shown in FIG. 8C.  In operation 306, the most significant web session events may be plotted in charts identifying
    the time and number of occurrences of the web session events associated with the timestamp outliers.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 10 depicts an example of the second module of the system that provides the real-time monitoring of web sessions using the previously created multivariate model of normal web session activity.  In operation 348, the multivariate model
    previously saved by the first module, is imported into the second module.  In operation 350, the analysis system extracts web session events from the session archive database in the same manner previously described above for generating the web session
    model.  However, the web session events may only be for a current monitoring time period and not the entire historical time period.  For example, instead of using a month of web session events for generating the model, only a last hour of web session
    events may be extracted from the session database.
    <BR><BR> In operation 352, the extracted web session events are processed in a same manner as described above where the first module generates the web session model.  For example, occurrences for the last hour of web session events may be reshaped to
    produce a single-row matrix that is normalized, filtered, and transformed using the model parameters.  In operation 354, the processed web session events are applied to the web session model.  Application of the saved parameters ensures that the newly
    extracted web session data is processed by exactly the same method that was applied for the model creation.
    <BR><BR> In operation 356, the two indicative distances to the model may be calculated for the timestamp element in the model space.  For example, the Hotelling T2 and DmodX distances to the model may be calculated for the timestamp representing the one
    hour monitoring period and then compared to the restored thresholds.  The timestamp may be identified as an outlier if the distance is outside of the threshold for either distance to the model.  In operation 358, a report may be generated identifying the
    most significant web session events contributors to the timestamp element.
    <BR><BR> The outlier notification process is controlled by the parameters stored into the configuration file 135 on FIG. 1.  This file contains, among others, the email server configuration and email addresses of the persons responsible for the outlier
    notification response.  The configuration file may also contain verbosity parameter that controls the level of notification that should be applied to the system.  The current timestamp may be or may not be an outlier.  In operation 358, the analysis
    system still may list the most significant N movers in a report and plot the most significant web session events in graphs.  If the timestamp element is not an outlier in operation 360, the graphs identifying the top movers may be displayed in a first
    color.  If the verbosity parameter is equal to 2 (high), an informational email may be sent to the addressees identified in the configuration file.  If the timestamp is identified as an outlier in operation 360, the graphs identifying the top movers may
    be displayed in a second color and an alert message may be sent to the correspondent email addressees in operation 362.  For example, the reports and graphs may be emailed to marketing personnel when no outliers are identified and the reports may also be
    emailed to IT personnel and management personnel when outliers are identified.
    <BR><BR> Thus, the analysis system identifies the web session events having a highest impact in causing abnormal web session operations.  Less significant web session events may not be periodically monitored and/or reported.  As explained above, some of
    the events may be excluded from the reports if the operator knows those events are known to create abnormal system operating conditions, such as a one day promotion.
    <BR><BR> The modeling and monitoring modules can be operated automatically as autonomous scripts.  In one example, the scripts may be scheduled to automatically run approximately half of the historical modeling period used for creating the model.  For
    example, if web session events are retained for one month, the web session model may be automatically refreshed every 2-3 weeks.  The monitoring periods also may be programmed to automatically generate reports for programmable time periods, such as for
    each hour of captured web session events.  Any other indicators of model deviation can be used to update the model.  For example, the model may be automatically updated after unusual web session activities, such as after a marketing promotion or after a
    holiday.
    <BR><BR> FIG. 11 depicts one example of how significant user interface events may be identified.  A group of user interface events 380 may be captured for a historical model generation period or for a more frequent monitoring period.  User interface
    events may include selecting a buy button icon 380A, clicking on a link #1 380B, entering characters into a field #5 380C, selecting a product checkout icon button 380D, and clicking on a link #6 380E.  These are of course just examples of any user
    interface events that may be captured during the web sessions.
    <BR><BR> The number of occurrences for each of user interface events 380 is counted and the occurrences processed as described above.  The processed user interface events may be used to generate web session activity model 382 and/or may be applied to an
    existing web session model 382.  A timestamp data point distance for user interface events 380 is identified and the significance of user interface events 380 to the derived distance are determined as explained above.  The timestamp data observation may
    or may not be identified as an outlier.
    <BR><BR> A report 384 may be generated listing the user interface events 380 in order of their significance to the timestamp observation distance to the model.  For example, user interface event 380C may have been identified as having a most significant
    influence to the timestamp.  The occurrences of user interface event 380A may have been identified as having a second most significant influence to the timestamp and occurrences of user interface event 380F for selecting a product tab may have been
    identified as having a third most significant influence.  If the timestamp observation is identified as an outlier, an alert may be sent along with report 384.
    <BR><BR> The most significant user inter interface events 380 may provide information on which user interface events are most likely to cause abnormal web session operations or may identify user interface events that are most difficult for users to
    successfully complete for normal web session operations.  For example, the most significant user interface events 380 may be associated with web sessions that did not result in online purchases.  Results of reports 384 may be used for customer experience
    segmentation.  For example, user interface events associated with particular web browsers may be segmented and analyzed to determine if user operating errors may be associated with particular web session environments.
    <BR><BR> Other operations may be initiated based on report 384.  For example, a portion of the web session associated with an outlier may be replayed.  At least some of the network data associated with the outlier may be synchronized with replaying at
    least some of the user interface events associated with the outlier in substantially a same order as previously occurring during the web sessions.  Replay may provide additional information regarding why the web session operated outside of normal
    operating boundaries.  Capturing and replaying web session events are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. RE41903 and U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,127,000 which have both been herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.
    <BR><BR> The system and apparatus described above may use dedicated processor systems, micro controllers, programmable logic devices, microprocessors, or any combination thereof, to perform some or all of the operations described herein.  Some of the
    operations described above may be implemented in software and other operations may be implemented in hardware.  One or more of the operations, processes, and/or methods described herein may be performed by an apparatus, a device, and/or a system
    substantially similar to those as described herein and with reference to the illustrated figures.
    <BR><BR> The processing device may execute instructions or "code" stored in memory.  The memory may store data as well.  The processing device may include, but may not be limited to, an analog processor, a digital processor, a microprocessor, a
    multi-core processor, a processor array, a network processor, or the like.  The processing device may be part of an integrated control system or system manager, or may be provided as a portable electronic device configured to interface with a networked
    system either locally or remotely via wireless transmission.
    <BR><BR> The processor memory may be integrated together with the processing device, for example RAM or FLASH memory disposed within an integrated circuit microprocessor or the like.  In other examples, the memory may comprise an independent device, such
    as an external disk drive, a storage array, a portable FLASH key fob, or the like.  The memory and processing device may be operatively coupled together, or in communication with each other, for example by an I/O port, a network connection, or the like,
    and the processing device may read a file stored on the memory.  Associated memory may be "read only" by design (ROM) by virtue of permission settings, or not.  Other examples of memory may include, but may not be limited to, WORM, EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH,
    or the like, which may be implemented in solid state semiconductor devices.  Other memories may comprise moving parts, such as a conventional rotating disk drive.  All such memories may be "machine-readable" and may be readable by a processing device.
    <BR><BR> Operating instructions or commands may be implemented or embodied in tangible forms of stored computer software (also known as "computer program" or "code").  Programs, or code, may be stored in a digital memory and may be read by the processing
    device.  "Computer-readable storage medium" (or alternatively, "machine-readable storage medium") may include all of the foregoing types of memory, as well as new technologies of the future, as long as the memory may be capable of storing digital
    information in the nature of a computer program or other data, at least temporarily, and as long at the stored information may be "read" by an appropriate processing device.  The term "computer-readable" may not be limited to the historical usage of
    "computer" to imply a complete mainframe, mini-computer, desktop or even laptop computer.  Rather, "computer-readable" may comprise storage medium that may be readable by a processor, a processing device, or any computing system.  Such media may be any
    available media that may be locally and/or remotely accessible by a computer or a processor, and may include volatile and non-volatile media, and removable and non-removable media, or any combination thereof.
    <BR><BR> A program stored in a computer-readable storage medium may comprise a computer program product.  For example, a storage medium may be used as a convenient means to store or transport a computer program.  For the sake of convenience, the
    operations may be described as various interconnected or coupled functional blocks or diagrams.  However, there may be cases where these functional blocks or diagrams may be equivalently aggregated into a single logic device, program or operation with
    unclear boundaries.
    <BR><BR> Having described and illustrated the principles of various examples, it should be apparent that the examples may be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles.  We claim all modifications and variation coming
    within the spirit and scope of the following claims.
