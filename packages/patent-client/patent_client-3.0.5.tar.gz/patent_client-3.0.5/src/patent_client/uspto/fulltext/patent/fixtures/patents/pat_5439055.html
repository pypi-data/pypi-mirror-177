              <p>The addition of fibrous materials in intimate mixture with particulates for
                     fracturing and gravel packing decreases or eliminates the flowback of
                     proppant and/or formation fines while stabilizing the sand pack and
                     lowering the demand for high polymer loadings in the placement fluids.
                     Preferred fibers include glass, aramide, nylon and other natural and
                     synthetic organic and inorganic fibers and metal filaments.

                     <CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER>
                     <HR> <BR><BR>This invention relates to the art of recovery of hydrocarbon values from subterranean
                     formations, and more particularly, to a method and means for controlling the transport of
                     particulate solids in conjunction with the flow of hydrocarbon
                     fluid from the formation into a wellbore.
                     <BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                     <BR><BR>Transport of particulate solids during the production of fluids from a wellbore has long
                     presented a problem in the recovery of fluid mineral values from subterranean formations. Such
                     transported particulate solids cannot only clog the wellbore
                     thereby limiting or completely stopping fluid production, they represent a significant wear factor
                     in well production equipment including pumps and seals used in the recovery process. Finally, these
                     particulate solids must be separated from the valuable
                     fluids adding further expense to the processing of these fluids for use.
                     <BR><BR>Particulates which are available for transport in fluids flowing to the wellbore may be
                     present due to an unconsolidated nature of the subterranean formation and/or as a result of various
                     well treatments placing particulate solids into the
                     formation or the near wellbore area such as by fracturing and gravel packing.
                     <BR><BR>Several means have been attempted in order to limit or eliminate flowback of particulate
                     proppant materials placed into the formation in a fracturing process. One means showing reasonable
                     effectiveness has been to gradually release fracturing
                     pressure once the fracturing operation has been completed so that fracture closure pressure acting
                     against the proppant builds gradually allowing proppant matrix to stabilize before fracturing fluid
                     flowback and well production can carry significant
                     quantities of the proppant out of the fractures and back to the wellbore. It has also been common
                     to use so-called "resin-coated proppant", that is, particulate proppant materials having an
                     adherent coating bonded to its outer surface so that the
                     proppant particles are bonded to each other, a process which further reduces the possibility of
                     proppant flowback. Since fracturing treatments may employ thousands or even millions of pounds of
                     proppant, the use of expensive, resin-coated proppants is
                     generally limited to use in the final stages of a fracturing treatment for economic purposes.
                     <BR><BR>In unconsolidated formations, it is common to place a filtration bed of gravel in the
                     near-wellbore area in order to present a physical barrier to the transport of unconsolidated
                     formation fines with the production of wellbore fluids. Typically,
                     such so-called "gravel packing operations" involve the pumping and placement of a quantity of
                     gravel and/or sand having a mesh size between 10 and 60 U.S. Standard Sieve Series mesh into the
                     unconsolidated formation adjacent to the wellbore. It is
                     sometimes also desirable to bind the gravel particles together in order to form a porous matrix
                     through which formation fluids can pass while straining out and retaining the bulk of the
                     unconsolidated sand and/or fines transported to the near wellbore
                     area by the formation fluids. The gravel particles may constitute a resin-coated gravel which is
                     either precured or can be cured by an overflush of a chemical binding agent once the gravel is in
                     place. It has also been known to add various binding
                     agents directly to an overflush of uncoated gravel particles in order to bind them together to form
                     the porous matrix.
                     <BR><BR>It has been known in the past to utilize fibrous materials in well treatment fluids in
                     order to prevent or limit fluid loss into a porous formation or vugular zone. In this regard,
                     glass, asbestos, cotton or cellulosic fibers have been pumped in
                     a slurry into a wellbore or formation in order to create a mat of fibrous material over areas of
                     high fluid loss. As the mat builds, flow of well treatment fluids into these high fluid loss areas
                     is inhibited or prevented. Such fluid loss agents are
                     typically pumped in conjunction with drilling fluids or in nonproppant-carrying pad solutions
                     preceding a proppant-laden fracturing fluid. The primary intent of using such fibrous materials in
                     these fluids is for arresting or inhibiting fluid flow of
                     fluids in certain desired areas of the wellbore or formation.
                     <BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
                     <BR><BR>The present invention provides a method and fluid for treating a subterranean formation and
                     a resultant porous solid pack which inhibits the flow of both deposited and natural formation
                     particulates and fines back through the wellbore with the
                     production of formation fluids.
                     <BR><BR>In accordance with the invention, a method of treating a subterranean formation penetrated
                     by a wellbore comprises the steps of providing a fluid suspension including a simultaneous mixture
                     of particulate material and a fibrous material, pumping
                     the fluid suspension including the mixture of the particulate material and fibrous material through
                     the wellbore and depositing the particulate and fibrous material mixture in the subterranean
                     formation.
                     <BR><BR>Further in accordance with the invention, the above-described method comprises providing a
                     particulate material having a size in the range of 10 to 100 mesh and a fibrous material selected
                     from a group consisting of natural and synthetic organic
                     fibers, glass fibers, ceramic fibers, carbon fibers, inorganic fibers and metal fibers and mixtures
                     of these fibers.
                     <BR><BR>Still further in accordance with the invention, a well treatment fluid comprises a fluid
                     suspension including a simultaneous mixture of a particulate material and a fibrous material.
                     <BR><BR>Still further in accordance with the invention, a means for inhibiting particulate
                     transport in subterranean wells comprises a porous pack including a particulate material having a
                     size ranging from about 10 to about 100 U.S. mesh in intimate
                     mixture with a fibrous material.
                     <BR><BR>It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a means and method whereby flowback
                     of particulate materials either pumped into a wellbore with a well treatment fluid or present as a

                     inhibited by the presence of fibers in an intimate mixture with a particulate material.
                     <BR><BR>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a means to control the flowback of
                     particulate material in subterranean fluid production without the use of complicated and expensive
                     resin formulations and procedures utilizing such resins to
                     form a porous, consolidated bed of particulate.
                     <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
                     <BR><BR>These and other objects of the invention are accomplished through the manner and form of
                     the present invention to be described hereinafter in conjunction with various examples of preferred
                     embodiments illustrating the present invention. It will
                     be understood that the examples presented are solely for the purpose of illustration and should not
                     in any way be construed as a limitation of the overall concept of the invention.
                     <BR><BR>In the treatment of subterranean formations, it is common to place particulate materials as
                     a filter medium and/or a proppant in the near wellbore area and/or in fractures extending outwardly
                     from the wellbore. In fracturing operations, proppant
                     is carried into fractures created when hydraulic pressure is applied to these subterranean rock
                     formations to a point where fractures are developed. Proppant suspended in a viscosified fracturing
                     fluid is then carried outwardly away way from the
                     wellbore within the fractures as they are created and extended with continued pumping. Ideally,
                     upon release of pumping pressure, the proppant materials remain in the fractures holding the
                     separated rock faces in an open position forming a channel for
                     flow of formation fluids back to the wellbore
                     <BR><BR>Proppant flowback is the transport of proppant sand back into the wellbore with the
                     production of formation fluids following fracturing. This undesirable result causes undue wear on
                     production equipment, the need for separation of solids from
                     the produced fluids and occasionally also decreases the efficiency of the fracturing operation
                     since the propane does not remain within the fracture and may limit the size of the created flow
                     channel.
                     <BR><BR>Currently, the primary means for addressing the proppant flowback problem is to employ
                     resin-coated proppants, resin consolidation of the proppant or forced closure techniques. The cost
                     of resin-coated proppant is high, ranging from $0.20 to
                     $0.40 per pound and is therefore used only as a tail-in the last five to twenty percent of the
                     proppant sand placement. Resin-coated proppant is not always effective since there is some
                     difficulty in placing it uniformly within the fractures and,
                     additionally, the resin coating can have a deleterious effect on fracture conductivity. Resin
                     coated proppant also interacts chemically with common fracturing fluid crosslinking systems such as
                     guar or hydroxypropyl guar with organo-metallics or borate. This interaction results in altered
                     crosslinking and/or break times for the fluids thereby affecting placement. Additionally, these
                     chemicals can dissolve the coating on the resin-coated proppant making their use ineffective
                     despite their high cost.
                     <BR><BR>In accordance with the present invention, the difficulties of using resin-coated proppants
                     are overcome by incorporating an amount of fibrous material in intimate mixture with conventional
                     proppants. The fibers act to bridge across constrictions
                     and orifices in the proppant pack and to stabilize the proppant pack with no or minimal effect on
                     proppant conductivity. While not wishing to be limited by theory, it appears that the fibers are
                     dispersed within the sand and, at the onset of sand
                     production from the fracture, the fibers become concentrated into a mat or other three-dimensional
                     framework which holds the sand in place thereby limiting further proppant flowback with the fluid
                     production.
                     <BR><BR>As used in this specification, the term `intimate mixture" will be understood to mean a
                     substantially uniform dispersion of components in a mixture. Similarly, the term "simultaneous
                     mixture" will be understood to mean that the mixture
                     components are blended in the initial steps of the process, i.e., prior to pumping.
                     <BR><BR>Fiber length, thickness, density and concentration are important variables in the success
                     of preventing proppant flowback. In accordance with the invention, the fiber length ranges upwardly
                     from about 2 millimeters and fiber diameter ranges of
                     from about 3 to about 200 microns. There appear to be no upper limits on the length of the fibers
                     employed from a stabilization standpoint. However, practical limitations of handling, mixing, and
                     pumping equipment currently limit the practical use
                     length of the fibers to about 100 millimeters. Fibrillated fibers can also be used and the
                     diameters of the fibrils can be significantly smaller than the aforementioned fiber diameters. The
                     fiber level used in the proppant pack can range from 0.01% to
                     50% by weight of the proppant sand. More preferably, the fiber concentration ranges from 0.1% to
                     5.0% by weight of proppant.
                     <BR><BR>The modulus or stiffness of the fiber appears to be important in determining performance.
                     Modulus is a measure of the resistance to deformation of a material and is a material property
                     rather than a sample phenomena. Stiffness is a sample
                     specific number which depends on both the material and its dimensions. As a general rule, fibers
                     with a modulus of about 70 GN/sq. m or greater are preferred. This includes materials like E-glass,
                     S-glass, AR-glass, boron, aramids, and graphitized
                     carbon fibers. Organic polymers other than the aramides usually have lower modulus values than
                     this. Therefore, in order for organic polymers, such as nylon, to be useful in this application
                     larger diameter fibers are required to provide equivalent
                     performance to that of E-glass and stiffer materials.
                     <BR><BR>In the materials listed above, E-glass is a commercially available grade of glass fibers
                     optimized for electrical applications, S-glass is used for strength applications and AR-glass has
                     improved alkali resistance. These terms are common in the
                     glass fiber industry and compositions of these types of glass are universally understood.
                     <BR><BR>A wide range of dimensions are useful. Length and diameter have been discussed above. An
                     aspect ratio (ratio of length to diameter) in excess of 300 is preferred. The fiber can have a
                     variety of shapes ranging from simple round or oval
                     cross-sectional areas to more complex trilobe, figure eight, star shaped, rectangular
                     cross-sectional areas or the like.
                     <BR><BR>Most commonly, straight fibers are used. Curved, crimped, spiral-shaped and other three
                     dimensional fiber geometries are useful. Likewise, the fibers may be hooked on one or both ends.
                     They may be of a composite structure, for example a glass
                     fiber coated with resin to increase fiber-fiber adhesion.
                     <BR><BR>The materials from which the fibers are formed is not a key variable provided that the
                     fibers do not chemically interact with components of the well treatment fluids and are stable in
                     the subterranean environment. Thus, the fibers can be of
                     glass, ceramic, carbon, natural or synthetic polymers or metal filaments. Mixtures of these fibers
                     may also be advantageously employed. Glass, carbon and synthetic polymers are preferred for their
                     low cost and relative chemical stability. The density
                     of the fibers used is preferably greater than one gram per cc to avoid separation by flotation in
                     the fluid/particulate slurry. Preferably, the fiber density is in the range of 1 to 4 grams per cc,
                     closely mimicking the density of the particulate
                     materials employed.
                     <BR><BR>Glass fibers are particularly preferred due to their relatively low cost, easy availability
                     and high stiffness. Because of the fact that placement fluids and subterranean formation fluids
                     tend to have an alkaline pH, it is most preferred to use
                     an alkaline resistant glass (hereinafter AR-glass) having a high zirconium content. The use of more
                     common, commercially available silica glasses is possible within the scope of this invention but,
                     the solubility of these glasses in an alkaline medium,
                     particularly at elevated temperatures, may affect the long term stability of the fiber/proppant
                     mixture over its lifetime in the wellbore.
                     <BR><BR>A number of different proppants can be used in this invention. Sized sand and synthetic
                     inorganic proppants are the most common. Examples include 40/60 sized sand, 20/40 sized sand, 16/20
                     sized sand, 12/20 sized sand and similarly sized ceramic
                     proppants such as 37 CARBOLITE.TM." proppants.
                     <BR><BR>The proppant can be resin coated sand or ceramic proppant. Resin coated sand is used in
                     some cases as a substitute for more expensive ceramic proppants because both are claimed to be more
                     crush resistant than sand. The addition of fibers would
                     aid in the control of proppant flowback or serve the other purposes described herein.
                     <BR><BR>The combination of resin coated sand and fibers would provide a stronger pack than either
                     system alone. This may be useful in itself. In addition, the fibers could allow use of more highly
                     precured resin coated proppants thereby minimizing the
                     deleterious interaction of curable resin coated proppant with typical fracturing fluid components.
                     <BR><BR>The preferred job execution practice is to mix the fibrous material throughout the entire
                     batch of proppant to be pumped during the job. This may be accomplished by adding the fiber to the
                     proppant before it is mixed with the fluid, adding the
                     fiber to the fluid before it is mixed with the proppant or by adding a slurry of fibers at some
                     other stage, preferably before the slurry is pumped downhole.
                     <BR><BR>In certain cases, it may be preferred to pump the slurry of proppant and fiber only during
                     a portion of the job, for example as the last 10-25% of the proppant into the fracture as a
                     "tail-in" to control flow back in the most economical manner or
                     for other reasons. The slug could also be pumped at other stages, for example to provide an
                     absorbed scale inhibitor to be pumped to the front of the fracture.
                     <BR><BR>In certain cases, it may be desired to pump small slugs of the slurry of proppant and fiber
                     in between slugs of slurry of proppant or to pump small slugs of a slurry of fiber between slugs of
                     proppant slurry. This could conceivably be used to
                     control flow dynamics down the fracture, for example by providing more plugflow-like behavior.
                     Pumping of small slugs of slurry of fiber as the tail-in is one example of this general procedure.
                     <BR><BR>The slurry of a mixture of proppant and fibers is useful for various reasons in the entire
                     range of reservoir applications from fracturing to sand control. This especially includes the newer
                     technologies of frac-and-sand-pack and high
                     permeability stimulation. In these applications formation permeabilities are typically higher than
                     those for classical fracturing, extending into the 10 md to 2 darcy range. As a result, the
                     fractures are shorter (e.g. 10-200 ft) and wider (e.g. 1/2-2
                     inches) than classical fractures. Control of flowback of proppant on these types of jobs can reduce
                     or eliminate the need for costly hardware such as gravel pack screens in the hole and simplify job
                     design.
                     <BR><BR>The selection of fiber can be based on chemical as well as physical reasons. For example,
                     in gravel packing and related applications where it is anticipated that the resulting pack-in-place
                     will be treated with acid mixtures containing
                     hydrofluoric acid, carbon fibers will be preferred over glass fibers when long life of the fibers
                     is desired.
                     <BR><BR>The opposite may also be desired. Use of carbon fibers through the first 90% or so of the
                     job followed by glass fibers in the tail-in would result in a pack which could be treated with
                     solutions of hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the glass, allow
                     flowback of a small portion of the sand at the face of the fracture and improve well productivity.
                     Pumping alternate slugs of proppant/fiber slurries containing the different fibers could be
                     followed by treatment with acid to produce fracture with high
                     permeability zones (where the glass fibers were) but with stable proppant/fiber pack zones (where
                     the carbon fibers were) to keep the fracture open.
                     <BR><BR>Beyond the advantages of avoiding proppant flowback, additional advantages have been noted
                     in the use of fibrous materials in the well treatment fluid. The presence of fibers in the fluid
                     slows the settling rate of the solid materials in the
                     fluid thereby permitting the use of lesser amounts of polymeric gelling material in the placement
                     fluid. This feature offers the advantages of less cost, greater retained permeability, a need for
                     lower concentrations of breaker and avoidance of chemical
                     interaction with the treatment fluid components.
                     <BR><BR>The fluid loss properties of the fibers are also available when fibers are incorporated
                     into a proppant carrying fracturing fluid. In areas of high fluid loss, the fibers and sand will
                     concentrate into a mat thereby limiting additional fluid
                     loss in these areas.
                     <BR><BR>Fibers also offer an opportunity to place well treatment chemicals in a dispersed form
                     within the proppant pack. Thus, porous or hollow or dissolvable fibers can be filled or formed with
                     various materials such as polymer breakers, scale
                     inhibitors, and/or paraffin and asphaltene inhibitors which can be slowly released within the pack.
                     <BR><BR>The following examples will illustrate several formulations incorporating fibers. It will
                     be understood that the presentation of these examples is solely for the purpose of illustrating the
                     invention and should not be considered in any way a
                     limitation on the scope or applicability of the concept of the present invention. <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
                     (CONTROL)
                     <BR><BR>The leakoff rate of a borate-crosslinked guar fracturing fluid was determined in the
                     following manner: A fracturing fluid was prepared from synthetic seawater containing 30 lb/1000 gal
                     of a polymer slurry, 1.0 gal/1000 gal surfactant, 0.5
                     gal/1000 gal bactericide and 0.25 gal/1000 gal antifoaming agent. Approximately 2000 ml of this
                     fluid was crosslinked with a borate crosslinking agent, poured into a large barold cell and heated
                     to 200 F. for 30 minutes. Using 1000 psi pressure, a
                     fluid leakoff test was performed with a one inch sandstone core having a low permeability (0.5
                     millidarcy). Results are presented in Table A.

                     <BR><BR>In a manner similar to example 1, the behavior of fiber/fracturing fluid mixtures were
                     determined. All tests were performed identical to example 1 but included 2.0 g of glass fibers
                     (1/2" long and 16 microns in diameter) that were added to the
                     fluid prior to crosslinking. Other modifications to example 1 were:
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2 contains 30 lb/1000 gal of a polymer slurry.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3 contains 25 lb/1000 gal of a polymer slurry.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4 was prepared using 2% KCl tap water, 30 lb/1000 gal polymer slurry, 1.0 gal/1000
                     gal surfactant, 0.5 gal/1000 gal bactericide and 0.25 gal/1000 gal antifoaming agent. No
                     crosslinker was added to the system.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 5 is identical to Example 3 but a sandstone core having a permeability of 100
                     millidarcy was used.
                     <BR><BR>The data are presented in Table A. These data demonstrate that the fibers dramatically
                     decrease the leakoff rate under fracturing conditions.

                     <BR><BR>The leakoff rate of a particulate carrying fluid was measured. The fluid contained tap
                     water and 80 lb/1000 gal. of hydroxyethylcellulose. The particulate was a sized calcium carbonate
                     (1-500 microns) which was added at a concentration of 0.5
                     lbs/gallon of fluid. Approximately 250 mls of this fluid was blended and added to a large barold
                     fluid loss cell preheated to 175 F. After 15 minutes, 500 psi of nitrogen pressure was applied to
                     force the fluid against a one inch sandstone core having a

                     The fibers were added to the fluid at the time of the

                     <BR><BR>Example 10 (fibers alone) showed no migration into the core. Particulate systems (Example
                     6) always show some migration into the core.
                     <BR><BR>The data demonstrate superior leakoff control by the fibers. An additional advantage of
                     fibers is no particulate migration into gravel pack or formation, therefore, less damage.
                     <BR><BR>The following examples illustrate the ability of fibrillated fibers to stabilize proppant
                     packs:
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 11: (CONTROL)
                     <BR><BR>200 grams 20/40 mesh sand in 105 ml aqueous guar solution was poured into a 25mm diameter
                     glass column fitted with a bottom valve. Permeability of the pack was 380 darcies. The sand readily
                     flowed through the 1/8 inch diameter valve when it was
                     opened.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 12
                     <BR><BR>In a similar manner, the Example 11 was repeated but 2 g polyacrylonitrile fibrillated
                     fiber was mixed with the same slurry before it was poured into the column. The pack permeability
                     was 120 darcies. The pack did not flow out when the valve
                     was opened. It was also stable when the valve was completely removed leaving a 1/4 inch diameter
                     hole directly under the sand pack.
                     <BR><BR>This illustrates the ability of fibrillated fibers to consolidate a sand pack.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 13
                     <BR><BR>Fibers Stabilize Sand Pack: A 30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution was made. The
                     composition of this fluid was the same as in Example 1. Fifty ml of this fluid were mixed with 0.8
                     grams of 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fibers.
                     They were mixed with a Hamilton Beach stirrer at low speed for 15 seconds. 100 grams of 20/40
                     proppant sand were added to the mixture and mixed by hand in a closed 4 oz. jar by gentle shaking.
                     The resulting mixture was poured into a vertical glass
                     column 12 mm in diameter with a "T" section at the bottom. The left end of the "T" had a screen
                     installed and the right end did not. First, water was flowed down the column and out the left side
                     of the "T" to clean the guar from the sand/fiber and make
                     a pack. The permeability of the pack was then measured. It was 278 darcies.
                     <BR><BR>Next, the water flowed left to right across the "T". This washed the sand and fiber from
                     the "T" section. The sand/fiber pack in the column section remained stable.
                     <BR><BR>The water direction was then changed to flow down the column and out the right side of the
                     "T". This created a pressure drop across the sand/fiber pack, and no screen prevented the sand from
                     moving with the flow. The pressure drop was increased
                     (by increasing the flow rate) until the sand/fiber pack failed and flowed out of the vertical
                     section of the column. The pressure drop across the sand/fiber pack required to do this was in
                     excess of 275 kPa (40 psi). Almost none of the sand in the
                     sand/fiber pack flowed out of the vertical section of the column until the sand pack "failed."
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 14
                     <BR><BR>A 30 lb/1000 uncrosslinked guar solution was mixed with the proppant sand (50 ml solution
                     with 100 grams sand) following the same procedure as in Example 13 but WITHOUT the fiber. This
                     mixture was put into the column and the guar was cleaned out
                     of the sand pack in the same manner as in Example 13. The permeability of the sand pack was 250
                     darcies. The sand pack failed under an unmeasurably low pressure.
                     <BR><BR>These examples (13 and 14) illustrate that mixing fibers with the proppant sand caused the
                     formation of a stable pack in the column. The fibers held the sand in place against a much higher
                     force (pressure) than the sand without fibers. Also,
                     the fibers had a negligible effect on the permeability of the sand pack.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 15
                     <BR><BR>Nylon Fibers: Fifty ml of a 30 lb/1000 gallon guar solution were mixed with 0.2 grams of 20
                     mm long, 64 micron diameter, nylon polyamide fibers. The mixing was done in a similar manner to
                     that of Example 13. This mixture was poured into the
                     column and tested as described in Example 13. The permeability of the sand/fiber pack was 200
                     darcies. The sand/fiber pack failed at a drawdownpressure across the pack of 265 kPa.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 16
                     <BR><BR>Sand Pack Stabilization With High Viscosity Fluids: 1 gram of 32 mm long, 16 micron
                     diameter glass fiber was mixed with a solution of corn syrup and water having a viscosity of 600
                     centipoise. The mixing was done in a Hamilton Beach stirrer at
                     low speed for 10 seconds. 100 grams of 20/40 proppant sand was then mixed with the fiber and
                     solution. The mixture was poured into the column described in Example 13. In this case, the 600
                     centipoise corn syrup solution was flowed through the column.
                     The sand/fiber pack permeability was 352 darcies. The pressure drop across the sand/fiber pack was
                     increased with the flow direction out of the right side of the "T" (no screen). The pressure drop
                     across the sand pack was raised to 400 kPa without pack
                     failure.
                     <BR><BR>This example illustrates that the fibers cause the sand pack to be stable even with high
                     viscosity fluids flowing through them. High viscosity fluids flowing through the sand would occur
                     if a guar gel was flowed back through the fracture during
                     clean-up.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 17
                     <BR><BR>Settling: A 30 lb/1000 gallon guar/borate crosslinked gel was made. The composition was
                     that of the guar solution in Example 13. 12 mm, 16 micron diameter glass fibers (0.8 weight % of
                     sand) and 20/40 proppant sand were added to a quantity of
                     the gel such that the sand concentration was 10 lb/gallon of gel. The sand and fiber were added to
                     the guar solution prior the gel crosslinker solution. The fiber was added to the solution, and
                     dispersed with a Hamilton Beach mixer. This was added to
                     the sand in a closed jar and gently mixed by shaking. The composition of the crosslinker solution
                     was 0.3 grams boric acid, 0.6 grams sodium hydroxide, 1.2 grams sodium gluconate, 0.5 ml triethanol
                     amine, and 0.6 grams sodium thiosulfate for 500 ml of
                     guar solution. The resulting mixture was placed in a heated closed column and further mixed by
                     inverting the column once per minute. The mixture was heating to 66 degrees Celsius and the column
                     was oriented in the vertical. The mixture ran to the
                     bottom of the column. The settling of the sand and fiber in the guar gel were observed as a
                     function of time at 66 degrees Celsius. Percent settling was calculated as follows:
                     <BR><BR>Total height is the height of sand plus gel liquid. Sand height is the height of the top of
                     the sand layer. Maximum liquid height is determined with sand and water in the same amounts.
                     <BR><BR>After 315 minutes the settling for the sand and fiber was 17%. There was no tendency of the
                     sand and fibers to phase separate during the settling.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 18
                     <BR><BR>The experiment of Example 17 was repeated with 1.3% of the glass fiber based on the sand
                     weight. In this case, after 260 minutes the settling was 14%.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 19
                     <BR><BR>The sand alone in the fluid of Example 17 settled 60% in 300 minutes. By comparison with
                     Examples 17 and 18, this example shows that the glass fibers reduce the settling rate of the sand
                     in the gel.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 20
                     <BR><BR>Interaction with Borate Gel: Six liters of a 30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution
                     were mixed with 47.6 gram of 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fibers. The fiber level was based
                     on 8 lb/gallon sand loading. No sand was added to the
                     fiber/solution mixture. The fiber/solution mixture was allowed to sit approximately one half hour
                     after mixing. Two fifty ml samples were removed. The fibers were filtered from one of the fifty ml
                     samples. The Fann35 viscosity of each sample was
                     measured at 70 degrees F. The sample with fibers had viscosities of 51 and 30 cp. at 170 and 510
                     sec.sup.-1 rate respectively. The filtered sample had viscosities of 42 and 24 cp respectively. The
                     viscosities of the filtered sample were well within
                     specifications for this guar solution. The solution with fibers had a slightly higher viscosity.
                     <BR><BR>Next borate crosslinker solution (composition in Example 17) was added to both solutions.
                     The time to gelling was measured for both by "hang lip" methods. The filtered solution had a "hang
                     lip" time of 4 minutes, 44 seconds. The sample with
                     fiber had a "hang lip" time of 4 minutes 27 seconds. Both these crosslinking times are within
                     specifications for these guar gels.
                     <BR><BR>This example illustrates that the preferred glass fibers do not affect the viscosity and
                     the "hang lip" gel times of the borate crosslinked guar gel. This illustrates that the glass fibers
                     do not affect the guar gel chemistry or viscosity
                     significantly.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 21
                     <BR><BR>Interaction With Zirconate Gel: The same mixing procedure as in Example 20 was followed
                     with a 50 lb/1000 gallon hydroxypropyl guar solution. The 12 mm glass fibers were added to, then
                     filtered out of one aliquot of the solution. This aliquot
                     and another aliquot that had not been exposed to the fibers were crosslinked with a 4.5 lb/1000
                     gallon zirconium-solution. The solution was 40% zirconium crosslinker, 24% high temperature
                     stabilizer, and 36% water. Crosslinking hang lip times were 9:19
                     minutes for the sample not exposed to the fibers, and 10:13 minutes for the sample exposed to the
                     fibers. Again, the fibers do not affect the crosslinked gel chemistry.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE22
                     <BR><BR>Conductivity. Conductivity testing was done with 20/40 mesh proppant. The fluid was a 30
                     lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution. The composition was 17 ml of 2% KCl water, 0.12 ml guar
                     slurry, 0.02 ml fluorocarbon surfactant, and 0.005ml
                     defoamer. The fluid was mixed with 63 grams of 20/40 proppant. The test was done in a conductivity
                     cell at 250 F. and 5000 psi closure stress. The conductivity after 23 hours of flowback was 157
                     darcies.
                     <BR><BR>The test was repeated with the same quantities of fluid and proppant. In addition, 0.5
                     grams (0.8%) of 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fibers were mixed with the proppant and fluid.
                     The conductivity after 24 hours of flowback was 153
                     darcies.
                     <BR><BR>This example illustrates that the fibers have a negligible effect on proppant pack
                     permeability.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 23
                     <BR><BR>Slot Flow. The fiber/sand pack stability was tested in a slot geometry. 5 liters of 30
                     lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution were made (34 ml guar slurry, 5 ml surfactant, and 1.25
                     ml defoamer and 5000 ml of tap water). This was mixed by
                     recirculating the fluid through a holding tank and centrifuge pump for 15 minutes. 5000 grams of
                     20/40 sand was then added and allowed to disperse for approximately 1 minute. 50 grams of 12 mm
                     long, 16 micron diameter glass fiber were added to the
                     mixture. The resulting slurry was pumped into the slot.
                     <BR><BR>The slot is approximately 5-1/2 feet long, 1/4" wide and 6" high. The surfaces are smooth,
                     with the front surface being clear to allow observation. A screen was placed over the exit port so
                     that the sand could not flow out of the slot. The
                     slurry was pumped into the slot from the other end. In this geometry, a pack of sand and fibers
                     built up against the screen, while the fluid was allowed to flow through the screen to a holding
                     tank. A 6" long sand/fiber pack was built up against the
                     screen.
                     <BR><BR>The guar fluid was then washed from the pack with water. The screen was removed from the
                     end of the slot, leaving the pack with an open 1/4".times.6" face. Water was flowed through the
                     pack to test its strength. The water flow was increased
                     until a 6 psi pressure drop was supported by the pack. At this point the pack began to fail and
                     sand flowed out of the slot.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 24
                     <BR><BR>Slot Flow, Rough walls, Glass fibers: The same slurry as in Example 23 was again tested in
                     the slot geometry. In this example, the walls of the slot were roughened. This was done by adhering
                     a layer of 20/40 sand to the walls of the slot with
                     rubber cement. In this geometry, a 22" sand/fiber pack was obtained and the strength of the pack
                     exceeded 15 psi drawdown (upper limit on pump).
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 25
                     <BR><BR>Slot With Gas Flow: A similar slurry as used in Example 23 was used in this example. In
                     this example we used a 10 lb/1000 gallon guar solution. This slurry was pumped into the slot with
                     rough walls and the screen as described in Example 24.
                     The guar solution was washed from the sand/fiber pack with water. Then the pack was dried with air
                     flowing through it for 3-1/2 hours. The screen was removed and the test for pack strength was
                     performed. The pack length was 18". The air flow rate was
                     increased to 13 psi drawdownacross the pack. The pack did not fail.
                     <BR><BR>The pack was then further dried at low air flow rate for an additional two hours. The test
                     was repeated. The sand/fiber pack did not fail with flow up to an 11 psi drawdown across the pack.
                     <BR><BR>This example illustrates that the sand/fiber pack is resistant to gas flows as well as
                     water flows.

                     <BR><BR>The sand/fiber slurry was pumped into the rough walled slot with the screen at one end as
                     was described in Examples 23 and 24. The resulting sand pack was 14.5" long. The fluid was washed
                     from the sand fiber pack with water. The screen was
                     removed and the water was again flowed through the pack. The pack began to fail at 3 psi drawdown.

                     <BR><BR>The slurry was loaded into a 5-1/4" by 5-1/4" by 1/4" slot. The walls of the slot were
                     lined with Springwall sandstone. A closure stress of 250 psi was applied. The cell was heated to
                     210 F. The fluid was washed from the gel with a 1% KCl
                     solution flowing at a slow rate (50 ml/min). The brine was then washed from the cell with a

                     <BR><BR>The example demonstrates that fiber/sand slurries can be pumped with conventional pumping

                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 31
                     <BR><BR>Perforation Packing: The ability of fibers to keep sand in a reservoir over a 1/4"
                     perforation was tested. A model perforation 1/4" in diameter and 3" long with a 75 cubic inch
                     reservoir at the outlet was used for the tests. The reservoir was
                     equipped with a 20 mesh screen at the other side from the perforation. Slurry could then flow into
                     the reservoir through the perforation and out through the screen. 4.5 L of a 20 lbm/1000
                     gal/hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) solution was prepared (135 g
                     NH.sub.4 Cl (3 wt %), 28.3 mL HEC solution and dry caustic to raise the pH to 8). This was mixed by
                     recirculating the fluid through a holding tank and a centrifuge pump. The fluid was hydrated for
                     ca. 30 min. 13.5 g Aramide staple, 1/2" long, was
                     mixed in and 2,696.5 g 20/40 sand were added to the mixture (5 lbm/gal proppant, 0.5 wt % fiber
                     based on the proppant). The resulting slurry was pumped into the reservoir through the 1/4"
                     perforation. A pack of sand and fibers built up against the
                     screen, while the fluid was allowed to flow through the screen into the holding tank.
                     <BR><BR>After packing the performation, the lines, the holding tank and the pump were cleaned and
                     filled with water. The flow direction was reversed and water was pumped from the screen side
                     through the packed perforation. No proppant was produced
                     through the 1/4" hole even by increasing the flow rate till a pressure drop across the pack of 15
                     psi was reached and kept for several minutes. The water flow was turned off and on several times.
                     That did not produce sand either.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 32
                     <BR><BR>The same perforation was packed with 20/40 sand and 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass
                     fiber using a 30 lbm/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution. 4.5 L fluid were prepared (90 g KCl
                     (2 wt %), 4.5 mL surfactant, 1.125 mL defoamer, 30.6 mL
                     guar slurry) and hydrated for 30 min. 27 g glass fiber were added and after one minute 2,700 g
                     20/40 proppant (5 lbm/gal, 1 wt % fiber based on proppant). The packing and water flow were done as
                     in Example 31.
                     <BR><BR>The packed perforation was kept for 10 days. Within this time water was flown through it
                     ca. 5 times, each time turning the pump on and off several times. The pack was stable and produced
                     one teaspoon proppant at the most.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 33
                     <BR><BR>The same setup as in Example 31 except for a 1/2" perforation. This time polypropylene
                     fibers ( 1/2" long, 4 denier) and 30 lbm/1000 gal HEC were used.
                     <BR><BR>Fluid: 4.5 L. 135 g NH.sub.4 Cl, 42.5 mL HEC solution, caustic to raise the pH to 8.

                     <BR><BR>Examples 31 through 33 illustrate that different types of fibers may be used to hold sand
                     in place in the formation beyond the perforation tunnels. This is applicable to gravel packing,
                     where gravel is placed outside of the perforations to
                     stabilize subterranean formation sands.

                     <BR><BR>Stabilization of Different Types of Proppant: Column experiments were performed using the
                     fluid composition (30 lb/1000 gallon guar solution), and procedure as in Example 13. 50 ml aliquots
                     of fluid were mixed with 100 grams each of various
                     proppants and 1 gram (or 1.6 grams) each of 12 mm long, 16b micron diameter glass fibers. The
                     proppants were 20/40 "CARBOLITE.TM.", 20/40 "ACFRAC SB ULTRA.TM." curable resin coated sand, and
                     20/40 "ISOPAC.TM." light weight gravel. The "CARBOLITE"
                     proppant has approximately the same density as sand, but is more spherical. The "SB ULTRA" has
                     approximately the same density and sphericity as sand, but has a polymer coating. The "ISOPAC"
                     lightweight gravel is much less dense than sand, is more
                     spherical, and has a polymer coating.
                     <BR><BR>The results of the column tests are shown in Table C.

                     <BR><BR>Examples 13 and 34 illustrate that the coating and sphericity of the proppant do not affect
                     the ability of the fiber to strengthen the pack. Low density proppants ("ISOPAC") may require
                     greater amounts of fiber for pack strength.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 35
                     <BR><BR>The procedure of Example 31 was repeated except that the pack was made in such a way that
                     the half of the perforation model closest to the perforation 20 hole was filled with an identical
                     sand/fiber mixture while the back half of the perforation
                     was filed with sand. The pack was tested in the same way. No sand was produced.
                     <BR><BR>This example demonstrates that the proppant/fiber slurry may be used as a tail-in or pumped
                     in stages between slugs of proppant slurry.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 36
                     <BR><BR>Proppant/fiber pack strength tests were performed in a rectangular cell with inside
                     dimensions of 12.7 cm long, 3.8 cm wide, and 2.5 cm thick. The cell was open at both ends. A
                     perforation type geometry was set up in the cell by creating a
                     restriction 0.63 cm on all inside dimensions. The cell was set up with a screen at the outlet. A
                     slurry containing 500 ml of 30 lb/100 gallon guar solution in water (composition in Example 1), 500
                     grams or 20/40 sand, and water (composition in Example
                     1), 500 grams of 20/40 sand, and 1.25 grams of 7 micron by 0.63 cm carbon fiber was pumped into the
                     cell and formed a pack against the exit screen. The guar was washed from the pack and then the
                     screen was removed from the exit port. A closure stress
                     of 500 psi was applied to the face of the pack. Water was flowed from the inlet to outlet through
                     the length of the pack. The proppant and carbon fiber pack resisted the flow of water up to 35 kPa
                     (about 5 psi) before the pack filed and flowed through
                     the restriction.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 37
                     <BR><BR>The same test as above was performed by 5 grams of AR grade glass fibers (20 micron
                     diameter, 1.27 cm long) were added to the sand and carbon fiber slurry. The resulting pack held a
                     drawdown of 135 kPa (about 18 psi) without failing.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 38
                     <BR><BR>The same test as above was performed with a slurry of 500 ml 30 lb/1000 gallon guar
                     solution, 500 grams 20/40 sand, and 5 grams AR grade glass fibers (20 micron diameter, 1.27 cm
                     long). The pack failed at a drawdown of 36 kPa (5 psi).

                     <BR><BR>The same test as above was performed with a slurry of 500 ml 30 lb/1000 gallon guar
                     solution, and 50 grams 20/40 sand without fiber added. The pack failed immediately with the onset
                     of water flow, and no measurable pressure drop was maintained
                     across the pack.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLES 36-39 show that carbon fibers can be used to stabilize the pack and that mixtures
                     of fiber can result in stronger packs than a single fiber type.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 40
                     <BR><BR>Proppant fiber pack strength tests were performed in a disk shaped cell. The diameter of
                     the disk is 15.2 cm, and the thickness is 1.2.+-.0.05 cm. the cell has inlet and output openings
                     10.2 cm across. A screen was placed across the outlet. A
                     slurry containing 1000 ml of 50 lb/1000 gallon guar solution, 1000 grams of proppant, 15 grams of
                     AR glass fibers (20 micron diameter, 12.7 mm long) was pumped into the cell and formed a pack
                     against the screen. In each test the proppant size was
                     varied. The guar was washed from the pack, and then the screen was removed. Closure stress of 1000
                     psi was applied to the faces of the disk. The excess pack was cleaned from the cell, so that the
                     pack was perpendicular to the flow direction from inlet
                     and outlet. This resulted in a pack length from inlet to outlet of 11.4 cm. Water was then flowed
                     through the pack until it failed and proppant flowed out of the cell. This coincided with a
                     relaxation of the closure stress.

                     <BR><BR>500 ml of a 50 pound per 1000 gallon borate crosslinked guar gel were prepared. The gel
                     contained 3 grams guar, 10 grams potassium chloride 0.5 mL surfactant, 0.25 mL bactericide, 0.125
                     mL antifoam agent, 0.5 mL stabilizer (iron control), 0.6
                     grams oxygen scavenger, 0.6 grams boric acid, 1.5 grams sodium hydroxide, and 3 grams sodium
                     gluconate. 500 grams of 20/40 US mesh brady sand and 7.5 grams AR grade glass fiber (20 microns
                     diameter, 12.7 mm length) were mixed into the gel.
                     <BR><BR>The resulting slurry was poured into a metal tube 22.1 mm inside diameter, and 127 mm in
                     length. The ends of the tube were capped, and it was then heated to 150.degree. C. for 24 hours.
                     These conditions were sufficient to "break" the gel. The
                     tube was cooled, opened and a washer with 12.7 mm hole was fitted into one end of the tube. The
                     tube was connected to a water source such that the washer was at the outlet end of the tube.
                     Effectively the slurry mixture was held from sliding out of the
                     tube by the washer, but water could flow through the slurry sand pack.
                     <BR><BR>The water flow was initiated at a low flow rate to wash the broken gel from the sand pack.
                     No sand flowed out the tube with the water. The water flow rate was then increased. No sand flowed
                     until the flow rate reached 7.6 L/min. which
                     corresponded to 381 kPa drawdown across the pack. At this point the sand pack failed and ran out of
                     the tubing through the washer.
                     <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 42
                     <BR><BR>The same experiment as above was run with the crosslinked gel and sand, but without the AR

                     the cleaning of the broken gel from the pack.
