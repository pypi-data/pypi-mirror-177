Description: # EnergyPlus Python Apps
        
        This is a meta-project which simply depends on all the EnergyPlus "Official" Python utilities.
        This project itself does not create any new utilities, or contain any code.
        This really just pins the dependencies at specific versions and ensures compatability in the installation dependencies.
        
        ## Releases
        
        [![PyPIRelease](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/EnergyPlusPythonApps/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/EnergyPlusPythonApps/actions/workflows/release.yml)
        
        I think long term, this "project" itself will be tagged with versions in sync with EnergyPlus itself.
        Then to install all EnergyPlus Python utilities, simply execute, for example,  `pip install energyplus_python_apps==22.2.0`.
