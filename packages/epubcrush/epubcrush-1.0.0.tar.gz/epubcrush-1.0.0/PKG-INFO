Description: EPUB Crush
        ==========
        
        Removes media content and compresses [EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) files to reduce size.
        
        By default, all images, fonts, scipts, and styles will be removed from the EPUB.
        
        Why?
        -----
        
        EPUB is a fine format, but it includes many features that may not be desirable from a privacy or efficiency standpoint. This includes full JavaScript support (did you know that you can use WebGL inside an eBook?). Publishers often choose to include high-res images, custom fonts, styles, and other features that bloat the size of EPUBs beyond what is needed for the text content of a book. This application strips away everything but the plain text content.
        
        Why not just plain text?
        ------------------------
        
        EPUB adds a number of useful reading features (table of contents, metadata, etc) that are useful and not available in basic plain text.
        
        Method of Operation
        -------------------
