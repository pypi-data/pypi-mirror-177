This is what alembic is for!\n\n TODO ALEMBIC INSTRUCTIONS\n\n## Development\n\nThis project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. It also helps with pinning dependency and python\nversions. We also use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with hooks for [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/),\n[black](https://github.com/psf/black), and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for consistent code style and\nreadability. Note that this means code that doesn't meet the rules will fail to commit until it is fixed.\n\nWe use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for static type checking. This can be run [manually](#run-static-type-checking),\nand the CI runs it on PRs to the `main` branch. We also use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/) to run our tests.\nThis can be run [manually](#run-tests) and the CI runs it on PRs to the `main` branch.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).\n2. Run `poetry install --no-root`\n3. Run `source $(poetry env list --full-path)/bin/activate && pre-commit install && deactivate` to set up `pre-commit`\n\nYou're all set up! Your local environment should include all dependencies, including dev dependencies like `black`.\nThis is done with Poetry via the `poetry.lock` file.\n\n### Run Code Format and Linting\n\nTo manually run isort, black, and flake8 all in one go, simply run `pre-commit run --all-files`. Explore the `pre-commit` docs (linked above)\nto see more options.\n\n### Run Static Type Checking\n\nTo manually run mypy, simply run `mypy` from the root directory of the project. It will use the default configuration\nspecified in `pyproject.toml`.\n\n### Update Dependencies\n\nTo update dependencies in your local environment, make changes to the `pyproject.toml` file then run `poetry update` from the root directory of the project.\n\n### Run Tests\n\nTo manually run rests, you need to have a Postgres instance running locally on port 5432. One way to do this\nis to run a Docker container, then run the tests while it is active.\n\n1. (If you don't already have the image locally) Run `docker pull postgres`\n2. Run `docker run --rm --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432/tcp postgres`\n3. Run `DB_NAME=postgres pytest tests` from the root directory of the project. Explore the `pytest` docs (linked above)\nto see more options.\n\nNote that if you decide to run the Postgres container with different credentials (a different password, port, etc.) or\nvia a different method, you will likely need to update the test file to point to the correct Postgres instance.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to re-run the tests, you want to make sure you start over from a fresh Postgres\ninstance. If you run Postgres via Docker, you can simply `ctrl-C` to stop the image and start a new one.\n",
