# FAQ

#### Must I learn the theory to use it?

No! Just see the examples and it will be fine

#### Can I understand the code here?

Yes! The easier way is to look up the **python notebook** which contains the theory along examples

#### Is this code efficient?

No. It's written in python and the functions were made for easy understanding, not for performance.
That means: It's not very fast, but it works fine.
